<h3><a id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">This</span> attempt to sketch the history of England under the
Angevin kings owes its existence to the master whose name I
have ventured to place at its beginning. It was undertaken at
his suggestion; its progress through those earliest stages which
for an inexperienced writer are the hardest of all was directed
by his counsels, aided by his criticisms, encouraged by his
sympathy; and every step in my work during the past eleven
years has but led me to feel more deeply and to prize more
highly the constant help of his teaching and his example.
Of the book in its finished state he never saw a page. For
its faults no one is answerable but myself. I can only hope
that, however great may be its errors and its defects, it may
yet shew at least some traces of that influence which is so
abidingly precious to me.</p>

<p>I desire respectfully to express my gratitude to the Lord
Bishop of Chester and to Mr. Freeman, who, for the sake of
the friend who had commended me to their kindness, have
been good enough to help me with information and advice
on many occasions during my work.</p>

<p>A word of acknowledgement is due for some of the
maps and plans. The map of Gaul in the tenth century is
founded upon one in Mr. Freeman’s <cite><i>Norman Conquest</i></cite>. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii">viii</a></span>
plans of Bristol and Lincoln are adapted from those in the
<cite><i>Proceedings of the Archæological Institute</i></cite>; for Lincoln I was
further assisted by the local knowledge kindly placed at my
disposal by the Rev. Precentor Venables. For Oxford I have
followed the guidance of the Rev. Father F. Goldie, S.J. (<cite><i>A
Bygone Oxford</i></cite>), and of Mr. J. Parker (<cite><i>Early History of
Oxford</i></cite>); and for London, that of its historian the Rev. W. J.
Loftie, whom I have especially to thank for his help on some
points of London topography.</p>

<p>My greatest help of all has been the constant personal
kindness and ever-ready sympathy of Mrs. Green. To her,
as to my dear master himself, I owe and feel a gratitude
which cannot be put into words.</p>

<p>So closed the prophecy in which the dying king
Eadward the Confessor foretold the destiny in store for his
country after his departure. His words, mocked at by one
of the listeners, incomprehensible to all, found an easy
interpretation a hundred years later. The green tree of the
West-Saxon monarchy had fallen beneath Duke William’s
battle-axe; three alien reigns had parted its surviving
branch from the stem; the marriage of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> with a
princess of the old English blood-royal had grafted it in
again.<a id="Anchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 2.">[2]</a> One flower sprung from that union had indeed
bloomed only to die ere it reached its prime,<a id="Anchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 3.">[3]</a> but another
had brought forth the promised fruit; and the dim ideal of
national prosperity and union which English and Normans
alike associated with the revered name of the Confessor was
growing at last into a real and living thing beneath the
sceptre of Henry Fitz-Empress.</p>

<p>There are, at first glance, few stranger things in history
than the revival thus prefigured<span class="nobreak">:—</span>a national revival growing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2">2</a></span>
up, as it seems, in the most adverse circumstances, under the
pressure of an alien government, of a race of kings who
were strangers alike to the men of old English blood and
to the descendants of those who had come over with the
Conqueror: at a time when, in a merely political point of
view, England seemed to be not only conquered but altogether
swallowed up in the vast and varied dominions of the
house of Anjou. It was indeed not the first time that the
island had become an appendage to a foreign empire compared
with which she was but a speck in the ocean. Cnut
the Dane was, like Henry of Anjou, not only king of England
but also ruler of a great continental monarchy far
exceeding England in extent, and forming together with
her a dominion only to be equalled, if equalled at all, by
that of the Emperor. But the parallel goes no farther.
Cnut’s first kingdom, the prize of his youthful valour,
was his centre and his home, of which his Scandinavian
realms, even his native Denmark, were mere dependencies.
Whatever he might be when he revisited them, in his island-kingdom
he was an Englishman among Englishmen. The
heir of Geoffrey of Anjou and Matilda of Normandy, on the
other hand, was virtually of no nationality, no country; but
if he could be said to have a home at all, it was certainly
not on this side of the sea—it was the little marchland of
his fathers. In the case of his sons, the southern blood of
their mother Eleanor added a yet more un-English element;
and of Richard, indeed, it might almost be said that the
home of his choice was not in Europe at all, but in Holy
Land. Alike to him and to his father, England was simply
the possession which gave them their highest title, furnished
them with resources for prosecuting their schemes of continental
policy, and secured to them a safe refuge on which
to fall back in moments of difficulty or danger. It was not
till the work of revival was completed, till it had resulted in
the creation of the new England which comes to light with
Edward <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, that it could find a representative and a leader in
the king himself. The sovereign in whose reign the chief
part of the work was done stood utterly aloof from it in
sympathy; yet he is in fact its central figure and its most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3">3</a></span>
important actor. The story of England’s developement from
the break-down of the Norman system under Stephen to the
consolidation of a national monarchy under Edward <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> is
the story of Henry of Anjou, of his work and of its results.
But as the story does not end with Henry, so neither does
it begin with him. It is impossible to understand Henry
himself without knowing something of the race from which
he sprang; of those wonderful Angevin counts who, beginning
as rulers of a tiny under-fief of the duchy of France,
grew into a sovereign house extending its sway from one end
of Christendom to the other. It is impossible to understand
his work without knowing something of what England was,
and how she came to be what she was, when the young
count of Anjou was called to wear her crown.</p>

<p>The project of an empire such as that which Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>
actually wielded had been the last dream of William Rufus.
In the summer of 1100 the duke of Aquitaine, about to
join the Crusaders in Holy Land, offered his dominions in
pledge to the king of England. Rufus clutched at the offer
“like a lion at his prey.”<a id="Anchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 4.">[4]</a> Five years before he had
received the Norman duchy on the same terms from his
brother Robert; he had bridled its restless people and
brought them under control; he had won back its southern
dependency, his father’s first conquest, the county of Maine.
Had this new scheme been realized, nothing but the little
Angevin march would have broken the continuity of a
Norman dominion stretching from the Forth to the Pyrenees,
and in all likelihood the story of the Angevin kings would
never have had to be told. Jesting after his wont with his
hunting-companions, William—so the story goes—declared
that he would keep his next Christmas feast at Poitiers, if
he should live so long.<a id="Anchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 5.">[5]</a> But that same evening the Red
King lay dead in the New Forest, and his territories fell
asunder at once. Robert of Normandy came back from
Palestine in triumph to resume possession of his duchy;
while the barons of England, without waiting for his return,
chose his English-born brother Henry for their king.</p>

<p>Thirteen years before, at his father’s death, Henry, the
only child of William and Matilda who was actually born in
the purple—the child of a crowned king and queen, born on
English soil, and thus by birth, though not by descent,
entitled to rank as an English Ætheling—had been launched
into the world at the age of nineteen without a foot of land
that he could call his own. The story went that he had
complained bitterly to the dying Conqueror of his exclusion
from all share in the family heritage. “Have patience, boy,”
was William’s answer, “let thine elder brothers go before thee;
the day will come when thou shalt be greater than either of
them.” Henry was, however, not left a penniless adventurer
dependent on the bounty of his brothers; the Conqueror
gave him a legacy of ten thousand pounds as a solid provision
wherewith to begin his career. A year had scarcely
passed before Duke Robert, overwhelmed with troubles in
Normandy, found himself at his wits’ end with an empty
treasury, and besought Henry to lend him some money.
The Ætheling, as cool and calculating as his brothers were
impetuous, refused; the duke in desperation offered to sell
him any territory he chose, and a bargain was struck
whereby Henry received, for the sum of three thousand
pounds, the investiture of the Cotentin, the Avranchin, and
the Mont-<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>-Michel—in a word, the whole western end of
the Norman duchy.<a id="Anchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 6.">[6]</a> Next summer, while the duke was
planning an attempt on the English crown and vainly
awaiting a fair wind to enable him to cross the Channel, the
count of the Cotentin managed to get across without one,
to claim the estates in Gloucestershire formerly held by his
mother and destined for him by his father’s will. He was
received by William Rufus only too graciously, for the consequence
was that some mischief-makers, always specially
plentiful at the Norman court, persuaded Duke Robert that
his youngest brother was plotting against him with the
second, and when Henry returned in the autumn he had no
sooner landed than he was seized and cast into prison.<a id="Anchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 7.">[7]</a>
Within a year he was free again, reinstated, if not in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>
Cotentin, at least in the Avranchin and the Mont-<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>-Michel,
and entrusted with the keeping of Rouen itself against the
traitors stirred up by the Red King. William, while his
young brother was safe in prison, had resumed the Gloucestershire
estates and made them over to his favourite Robert
Fitz-Hamon. Henry in his natural resentment threw himself
with all his energies into the cause of the duke of Normandy,
acted as his trustiest and bravest supporter throughout
the war with Rufus which followed, and at the close of
the year crowned his services by the promptitude and valour
with which he defeated a conspiracy for betraying the Norman
capital to the king of England.<a id="Anchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 8.">[8]</a> The struggle ended in a
treaty between the elder brothers, in which neither of them
forgot the youngest. Their remembrance of him took the
shape of an agreement to drive him out of all his territories
and divide the spoil between themselves. Their joint attack
soon brought him to bay in his mightiest stronghold, the
rock crowned by the abbey of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Michael-in-Peril-of-the-Sea,
commonly called Mont-Saint-Michel. Henry threw
himself into the place with as many knights as were willing
to share the adventure; the brethren of the abbey did their
utmost to help, and for fifteen days the little garrison,
perched on their inaccessible rock, held out against their
besiegers.<a id="Anchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 9.">[9]</a> Then hunger began to thin their ranks; nothing
but the inconsistent generosity of Robert saved them from
the worse agonies of thirst;<a id="Anchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 10.">[10]</a> one by one they dropped away,
till Henry saw that he must yield to fate, abide by his
father’s counsel, and wait patiently for better days. He
surrendered; he came down from the Mount, once again
a landless and homeless man; and save for one strange
momentary appearance in England as a guest at the Red
King’s court,<a id="Anchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 11.">[11]</a> he spent the greater part of the next two
years in France and the Vexin, wandering from one refuge
to another with a lowly train of one knight, three squires,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
and one chaplain.<a id="Anchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 12.">[12]</a> He was at length recalled by the
townsmen of Domfront, who, goaded to desperation by the
oppressions of their lord Robert of Bellême, threw off his
yoke and besought Henry to come and take upon himself
the duty of defending them, their town and castle, against
their former tyrant. “By the help of God and the suffrages
of his friends,” as his admiring historian says,<a id="Anchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 13.">[13]</a> Henry was
thus placed in command of his father’s earliest conquest, the
key of Normandy and Maine, a fortress scarcely less mighty
and of far greater political importance than that from which
he had been driven. He naturally used his opportunity for
reprisals, not only upon Robert of Bellême, but also upon
his own brothers;<a id="Anchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 14.">[14]</a> and by the end of two years he had
made himself of so much consequence in the duchy that
William Rufus, again at war with the duke, thought it time
to secure his alliance. The two younger brothers met in
England, and when Henry returned in the spring of 1095
he came as the liegeman of the English king, sworn to fight
his battles and further his interests in Normandy by every
means in his power.<a id="Anchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 15.">[15]</a></p>

<p>William and Henry had both learned by experience
that to work with Robert for any political purpose was
hopeless, and that their true interest was to support each
other—William’s, to enlist for his own service Henry’s clear
cool head and steady hand; Henry’s, to secure for himself
some kind of footing in the land where his ultimate
ambitions could not fail to be centred. He had learned
in his wanderings to adapt himself to all circumstances and
all kinds of society; personally, he and Rufus can have had
little in common except their passion for the chase. Lanfranc’s
teaching, moral and intellectual, had been all alike
thrown away upon his pupil William the Red. Henry,
carefully educated according to his father’s special desire,
had early shown a remarkable aptitude for study, was a
scholar of very fair attainments as scholarship went among
laymen in his day, and retained his literary tastes not only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
through all his youthful trials but also through the crowd of
political and domestic cares which pressed upon his later
life. Yet such tastes seem almost as strange in Henry as
they would in William Rufus. The one prosaic element in
the story of Henry’s youth is the personality of its hero.
No man had ever less of the romantic or poetic temperament;
if he had none of the follies or the faults of chivalry,
he had just as little of its nobler idealism. From his first
bargain with Robert for the purchase of the Cotentin to his
last bargain with Fulk of Anjou for the marriage of his
heir, life was to him simply a matter of business. The
strongest points in his character were precisely the two
qualities which both his brothers utterly lacked—self-control,
and that “capacity for taking trouble” which is sometimes
said to be the chief element of genius. But of the higher
kind of genius, of the fire which kindles in the soul rather
than merely in the brain, Henry had not a spark. He was
essentially a man of business, in the widest and loftiest sense
of the words. His self-control was not, like his father’s, the
curb forcibly put by a noble mind upon its own natural
impetuosity; it was the more easily-practised calmness of
a perfectly cold nature which could always be reasonable
because it had to fight with no impulse of passion, which
was never tempted to “follow wandering fires” because they
lit in it no responsive flame; a nature in which the head
had complete mastery over the heart, and that head was one
which no misfortunes could disturb, no successes turn, and
no perplexities confuse.</p>

<p>The sudden vacancy of the English throne found every
one else quite unprepared for such an emergency. Henry
was never unprepared. His quickness and decision secured
him the keys of the treasury and the formal election of those
barons and prelates who had been members of the fatal
hunting-party, or who hurried to Winchester at the tidings
of its tragic issue; and before opposition had time to come
to a head, it was checked by the coronation and unction
which turned the king-elect into full king.<a id="Anchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 16.">[16]</a> Henry knew
well, however, that opposition there was certain to be.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
Robert of Normandy, just returned from the Crusade and
covered with glory, was sure to assert his claim, and as sure
to be upheld by a strong party among the barons, to whom
a fresh severance of England and Normandy was clearly not
desirable. In anticipation of the coming struggle, Henry
threw himself at once on the support of his subjects. In
addition to the pledges of his coronation-oath—taken almost
in the words of Æthelred to Dunstan<a id="Anchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 17.">[17]</a>—he issued on the
same day a charter in which he solemnly and specifically
promised the abolition of his brother’s evil customs in Church
and state, and a return to just government according to the
law of the land. The details were drawn up so as to touch
all classes. The Church, as including them all, of course
stood first; its freedom was restored and all sale or farming
of benefices renounced by the king. The next clause appealed
specially to the feudal vassals: those who held their
lands “by the hauberk”—the tenants by knight-service—were
exempted from all other imposts on their demesne
lands, that they might be the better able to fulfil their own
particular obligation. The tenants-in-chief were exempted
from all the unjust exactions with regard to wardships, marriages,
reliefs and forfeitures, which had been practised in
the last reign; but the redress was not confined to them;
they were distinctly required to exercise the same justice
towards their own under-tenants. The last clause covered
all the rest: by it Henry gave back to his people “the laws
of King Eadward as amended by King William.”<a id="Anchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 18.">[18]</a> Like
Cnut’s renewal of the law of Eadgar—like Eadward’s own
renewal of the law of Cnut—the charter was a proclamation
of general reunion and goodwill. As a pledge of its sincerity,
the Red King’s minister, Ralf Flambard, in popular estimation
the author of all the late misdoings, was at once cast
into the Tower;<a id="Anchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 19.">[19]</a> the exiled primate was fetched home as
speedily as possible; and in November the king identified
himself still more closely with the land of his birth by
taking to wife a maiden of the old English blood-royal,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>

<p>His precautions were soon justified. Robert had refused
the thorny crown of Jerusalem, but the crown of England
had far other charms; and his movements were quickened
by Ralf Flambard, who early in the spring made his escape
to Normandy.<a id="Anchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 21.">[21]</a> It was probably through Ralf’s management
that the duke won over some of the sailors who
guarded the English coast and thus got ashore unexpectedly
at Portsmouth while the king was keeping watch for him at
the old landing-place, Pevensey.<a id="Anchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 22.">[22]</a> At the first tidings of the
intended invasion Henry, like Rufus in the same case
thirteen years before, had appealed to Witan and people,
and by a renewal of his charter gained a renewal of their
fealty. No sooner, however, was Robert actually in England
than the great majority of the barons prepared to go over to
him in a body. But the king born on English soil, married
to a lady of the old kingly house, had a stronger hold than
ever Rufus could have had upon the English people; and
they, headed by their natural leader and representative, the
restored archbishop of Canterbury, clave to him with unswerving
loyalty.<a id="Anchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 23.">[23]</a> The two armies met near Alton;<a id="Anchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 24.">[24]</a> at the
last moment, the wisdom either of Anselm, of the few loyal
barons, or of Henry himself, turned the meeting into a peaceful
one. The brothers came to terms: Robert renounced his
claim to the crown in consideration of a yearly pension from
England; Henry gave up all his Norman possessions except
Domfront, whose people he refused to forsake;<a id="Anchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 25.">[25]</a> and, as in
the treaty made at Caen ten years before between Robert
and William, it was arranged that whichever brother lived
longest should inherit the other’s dominions, if the deceased
left no lawful heirs.<a id="Anchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 26.">[26]</a></p>

<p>The treaty was ratified at Winchester in the first days of
August;<a id="Anchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 27.">[27]</a> and thus, almost on the anniversary of the Red<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
King’s death, ended the last Norman invasion of England.
But the treaty of Winchester, like that of Caen, failed to
settle the real difficulty. That difficulty was, how to control
the barons. According to one version of the treaty, it
was stipulated that those who had incurred forfeiture in
England by their adherence to Robert and those who had
done the same in Normandy in Henry’s behalf should alike
go unpunished;<a id="Anchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 28.">[28]</a> according to another, perhaps a more probable
account, the brothers agreed to co-operate in punishing
traitors on both sides.<a id="Anchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 29.">[29]</a> Henry set to work to do his part
methodically. One after another, at different times, in
various ways, by regular process of law, the offenders were
brought to justice in England: some heavily fined, some
deprived of their honours and exiled. It was treason not so
much against himself as against the peace and order of the
realm that Henry was bent upon avenging; Ivo of Grantmesnil
was fined to the verge of ruin for the crime of making
war not upon the king in behalf of the duke, but upon his
own neighbours for his own personal gratification—a crime
which was part of the daily life of every baron in Normandy,
but which had never been seen in England before,<a id="Anchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 30.">[30]</a> and
never was seen there again as long as King Henry lived.
The most formidable of all the troublers of the land was
Henry’s old enemy at Domfront—Robert, lord of Bellême
in the border-land of Perche, earl of Shrewsbury and
Arundel in England, count of Alençon and lord of Montgomery
in Normandy, and now by his marriage count of
Ponthieu. Robert was actually fortifying his castles of
Bridgenorth and Arundel in preparation for open revolt
when he was summoned to take his trial on forty-five
charges of treason against the king of England and the
duke of Normandy. As he failed to answer, Henry led his
troops to the siege of Bridgenorth. In three weeks it surrendered;
Shrewsbury and Arundel did the same, and
Robert of Bellême was glad to purchase safety for life and
limb at the cost of all his English possessions.<a id="Anchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 31.">[31]</a></p>

<p>From that moment Henry’s position in England was
secured; but all his remonstrances failed to make his indolent
elder brother fulfil his part of their compact. The traitors
whom Henry expelled from England only carried their treason
over sea to a more congenial climate, and the helpless, heedless
duke looked passively on while Robert of Bellême,
William of Mortain the banished earl of Cornwall, and their
fellows slaked their thirst for vengeance upon King Henry
by ravaging the Norman lands of those who were faithful to
him in England.<a id="Anchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 32.">[32]</a> Their victims, as well as Henry himself,
began to see that his personal intervention alone could re-establish
order in the duchy. On his appearance there in 1104
he was joined by all the more reasonable among the barons.
For the moment he was pacified by fresh promises of
amendment on Robert’s part, and by the cession of the
county of Evreux; but he knew that all compromise had
become vain; and in the last week of Lent 1105 he
landed again at Barfleur in the full determination of making
himself master of Normandy. His Norman partisans rallied
round him at once,<a id="Anchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 33.">[33]</a> and he was soon joined by two valuable
allies, Elias count of Maine and his intended son-in-law,
the young count Geoffrey of Anjou.<a id="Anchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 34.">[34]</a> It was they
who won for Henry his first success, the capture of Bayeux.<a id="Anchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 35.">[35]</a>
Warned by the fate of this unhappy city, which was burnt
down, churches and all, Caen surrendered at once, and Henry
thus came into possession of the Norman treasury. A siege
of Falaise failed through the unexplained departure of Count
Elias,<a id="Anchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 36.">[36]</a> and the war dragged slowly on till Henry, now busy
in another quarter with negotiations for the return of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Anselm, went back at Michaelmas to England. Thither
he was followed first by Robert of Bellême, then by Robert
of Normandy,<a id="Anchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 37.">[37]</a> both seeking for peace; but peace had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
become impossible now. Next summer Henry was again
in Normandy, reconciled to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Anselm, released from anxieties
at home, free to concentrate all his energies upon the
final struggle. It was decided with one blow. As he
was besieging the castle of Tinchebray on Michaelmas Eve
Duke Robert at the head of all his forces approached and
summoned him to raise the siege. He refused, “preferring,”
as he said, “to take the blame of a more than civil war for
the sake of future peace.” But when the two hosts were
drawn up face to face, the prospect of a battle seemed too
horrible to be endured, composed as they were of kinsmen
and brothers, fathers and sons, arrayed against each other.
The clergy besought Henry to stay his hand; he listened,
pondered, and at length sent a final message to his brother.
He came, he said, not wishing to deprive Robert of his
duchy or to win territories for himself, but to answer the
cry of the distressed and deliver Normandy from the misrule
of one who was duke only in name. Here then was
his last proposition: “Give up to me half the land of
Normandy, the castles and the administration of justice
and government throughout the whole, and receive the
value of the other half annually from my treasury in
England. Thus you may enjoy pleasure and feasting to
your heart’s content, while I will take upon me the labours
of government, and guarantee the fulfilment of my pledge,
if you will but keep quiet.” Foolish to the last, Robert
declined the offer; and the two armies made themselves
ready for battle.<a id="Anchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 38.">[38]</a> In point of numbers they seem to have
been not unequally matched, but they differed greatly in
character. Robert was stronger in footsoldiers, Henry in
knights; the flower of the Norman nobility was on his
side now, besides his Angevin, Cenomannian and Breton
allies;<a id="Anchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 39.">[39]</a> while of those who followed Robert some, as the
issue proved, were only half-hearted. Of Henry’s genuine
English troops there is no account, but the men of his
own day looked upon his whole host as English in contradistinction
to Robert’s Normans, and the tactics adopted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
in the battle were thoroughly English. The king of
England fought on foot with his whole army, and it seems
that the duke of Normandy followed his example.<a id="Anchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 40.">[40]</a></p>

<p>The first line of the Norman or ducal host under
William of Mortain charged the English front under Ralf
of Bayeux, and by the fury of their onset compelled them
to fall back, though without breaking their ranks. The
issue was still doubtful, when the only mounted division of
Henry’s troops, the Bretons and Cenomannians under Count
Elias, came up to the rescue, took the duke’s army in flank,
and cut down two hundred men in a single charge. Those
Cenomannian swords which William the Conqueror was so
proud to have overcome now carried the day for his youngest
son. Robert of Bellême, as soon as he saw how matters
were going, fled with all his followers, and the duke’s army
at once dissolved.<a id="Anchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 41.">[41]</a> In Henry’s own words, “the Divine
Mercy gave into my hands, without much slaughter on our
side, the duke of Normandy, the count of Mortain, William
Crispin, William Ferrers, Robert of Estouteville, some four
hundred knights, ten thousand foot—and the duchy of
Normandy.”<a id="Anchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 42.">[42]</a></p>

<p>Forty years before, on the very same day, William the
Conqueror had landed at Pevensey to bring the English
kingdom under the Norman yoke. The work of Michaelmas
Eve, 1066, was reversed on Michaelmas Eve, 1106; the
victory of Tinchebray made Normandy a dependency of
England.<a id="Anchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 43.">[43]</a> Such was the view taken by one of the most
clear-sighted and unprejudiced historians of the time, a man
of mingled Norman and English blood. Such was evidently
the view instinctively taken by all parties, and the instinct
was a true one, although at first glance it seems somewhat
hard to account for. The reign of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, if judged
merely by the facts which strike the eye in the chronicles of
the time, looks like one continued course of foreign policy
and foreign warfare pursued by the king for his own personal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>
ends at the expense of his English subjects. But the
real meaning of the facts lies deeper. The comment of the
archbishop of Rouen upon Henry’s death—“Peace be to
his soul, for he ever loved peace”<a id="Anchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 44.">[44]</a>—was neither sarcasm nor
flattery. Henry did love peace, so well that he spent his
life in fighting for it. His early Norman campaigns are
enough to prove that without being a master of the art of
war like his father, he was yet a brave soldier and a skilful
commander; and the complicated wars of his later years,
when over and over again he had to struggle almost single-handed
against France, Flanders and Anjou, amid the endless
treasons of his own barons, show still more clearly his
superiority to nearly all the other generals of his time. But
his ambitions were not those of the warrior. Some gleam
of the old northman’s joy of battle may have flashed across
the wandering knight as he defied his besiegers from the
summit of his rock “in Peril of the Sea,” or swooped down
upon the turbulent lords of the Cenomannian border, like an
eagle upon lesser birds of prey, from his eyrie on the crest
of Domfront; but the victor of Tinchebray looked at his
campaigns in another light. To him they were simply a
part of his general business as a king; they were means to
an end, and that end was not glory, nor even gain, but the
establishment of peace and order. In his thirteen years of
wandering to and fro between England, Normandy and
France he had probably studied all the phases of tyranny
and anarchy which the three countries amply displayed, and
matured his own theory of government, which he practised
steadily to the end of his reign. That theory was not a very
lofty or noble one; the principle from which it started and
the end at which it aimed was the interest of the ruler rather
than of the ruled; but the form in which Henry conceived
that end and the means whereby he sought to compass it
were at any rate more enlightened than those of his predecessor.
The Red King had reigned wholly by terror;
Henry did not aspire to rule by love; but he saw that, in a
merely selfish point of view, a sovereign gains nothing by
making himself a terror to any except evil-doers, that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
surest basis for his authority is the preservation of order,
justice and peace, and that so far at least the interests
of king and people must be one. It is difficult to get
rid of a feeling that Henry enforced justice and order from
motives of expediency rather than of abstract righteousness.
But, as a matter of fact, he did enforce them all
round, on earl and churl, clerk and layman, Norman and
Englishman, without distinction. And this steady, equal
government was rendered possible only by the determined
struggle which he waged with the Norman barons and
their French allies. His home policy and his foreign
policy were inseparably connected; and the lifelong battle
which he fought with his continental foes was really the
battle of England’s freedom.</p>

<p>From the year 1103 onward the battle was fought
wholly on the other side of the Channel. In England
Henry, as his English subjects joyfully told him, became
a free king on the day when he drove out Robert of
Bellême.<a id="Anchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 45.">[45]</a> One great hindrance indeed still remained,
hanging upon him like a dead weight throughout his early
struggles in Normandy; the controversy concerning ecclesiastical
investitures, with which the rest of Europe had been
aflame for a quarter of a century before it touched England
at all. The decree of the Lateran Council of 1075 forbidding
lay sovereigns to grant the investiture of any
spiritual office with ring and staff was completely ignored
in practice by William the Conqueror and Lanfranc.
Their position on this and all other matters of Church
policy was summed up in their reply to Pope Gregory’s
demand of fealty: William would do what the English
kings who went before him had done, neither more nor
less.<a id="Anchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 46.">[46]</a> But the king and the primate were not without
perceiving that, as a necessary consequence of their own
acts, the English Church had entered upon a new and more
complicated relation both to the state and to the Apostolic
see, and that the day must shortly come when she would be
dragged from her quiet anchorage into the whirlpool of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
European controversies and strifes. Their forebodings found
expression in the three famous rules of ecclesiastical policy
which William laid down for the guidance of his successors
rather than himself<span class="nobreak">:—</span>that no Pope should be acknowledged
in England and no letter from him received there
by any one without the king’s consent;—that no Church
council should put forth decrees without his permission
and approval;—and that no baron or servant of the crown
should be laid under ecclesiastical censure save at the king’s
own command.<a id="Anchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 47.">[47]</a> These rules, famous in the two succeeding
reigns under the name of “paternal customs,” were never
put to the test of practice as long as William and Lanfranc
lived. The Red King’s abuse of the two first, by precipitating
the crisis and driving <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Anselm to throw himself into
the arms of Rome, showed not so much their inadequacy
as the justice of the misgivings from which they had sprung.
Henry at his accession took his stand upon them in the
true spirit of their author; but the time was gone by;
Anselm too had taken his stand upon ground whence in
honour and conscience he could not recede, and the very
first interview between king and primate threw open the
whole question of the investitures. But in England and in
the Empire the question wore two very different aspects.
In England it never became a matter of active interest or
violent partisanship in the Church and the nation at large.
Only a few deep thinkers on either side—men such as
Count Robert of Meulan among the advisers of the king,
perhaps such as the devoted English secretary Eadmer
among the intimate associates of Anselm—ever understood
or considered the principles involved in the case, or its bearing
upon the general system of Church and state. Anselm
himself stood throughout not upon the abstract wrongfulness
of lay investiture, but upon his own duty of obedience
to the decree of the Lateran Council; he strove not for the
privileges of his order, but for the duties of his conscience.
The bishops who refused investiture at Henry’s hands clearly
acted in the same spirit; what held them back was not so
much loyalty to the Pope as loyalty to their own metropolitan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>.
The great mass of both clergy and laity cared
nothing at all how the investitures were given, and very
little for papal decrees; all they cared about was that they
should not be again deprived of their archbishop, and left, as
they had already been left too long, like sheep without a
shepherd. In their eyes the dispute was a personal one
between king and primate, stirred up by Satan to keep the
English Church in misery.</p>

<p>In the manner in which it was conducted on both sides,
the case compares no less favourably with its continental
parallel and with the later contest in England of which it
was the forerunner, and for which, in some respects, it unquestionably
furnished a model, though that model was very
ill followed. For two years the dispute made absolutely no
difference in the general working of the Church; Anselm
was in full enjoyment of his canonical and constitutional
rights as primate of all Britain; he ruled his suffragans, held
his councils, superintended the restoration of his cathedral
church, and laboured at the reform of discipline, with Henry’s
full concurrence; and the clergy, with the archbishop at
their head, were the life and soul of the party whose
loyalty saved the king in his struggle with the barons.
Even when Anselm’s position in England had become untenable,
he went over sea in full possession of his property,
as the king’s honoured friend and spiritual father. Not till
Henry was provoked by a papal excommunication of all
the upholders of the obnoxious “paternal customs” except
himself, did he seize the temporalities of the archbishopric;
and even then Anselm, from his Burgundian retreat, continued
in active and unrestrained correspondence with his
chapter and suffragans, and in friendly communication not
only with Queen Matilda, but even with the king himself.
And when at last the archbishop who had gone down on
his knees to the Pope to save William Rufus from excommunication
threatened to put forth that very sentence against
William’s far less guilty brother, he was only, like Henry
himself in Normandy at the same moment, preparing his
most terrible weapon of war as the surest means of obtaining
peace. Henry’s tact warned him, too, that the time for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
settlement was come, and the sincerity of his motives enabled
him to strike out a line of compromise which both
parties could accept without sacrificing their own dignity or
the principles for which they were contending. The English
king and primate managed to attain in seven years of quiet
decorous negotiation, without disturbing the peace or tarnishing
the honour of either Church or crown, the end to which
Pope and Emperor only came after half a century of tumult,
bloodshed and disgrace; the island-pontiff who “loved
righteousness and hated iniquity,” instead of “dying in exile”
like his Roman brother, came home to end his days in
triumph on the chair of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Augustine. The settlement
made little or no practical difference as far as its immediate
object was concerned. Henry ceased to confer the spiritual
insignia; but the elections, held as of old in the royal court,
were as much under his control as before. He yielded the
form and kept the substance; the definite concession of the
bishops’ homage for their temporalities fully compensated
for the renunciation of the ceremonial investiture. But the
other side, too, had gained something more than a mere
form. It had won a great victory for freedom by bringing
Henry to admit that there were departments of national life
which lay beyond the sphere of his kingly despotism. It
had, moreover, gained a distinct practical acknowledgement
of the right of the Apostolic <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curia</span> to act as the supreme
court of appeal in ecclesiastical causes, like the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curia Regis</span>
in secular matters. In a word, the settlement indicated
plainly that the system of William and Lanfranc was doomed
to break down before long. It broke down utterly when
Anselm and Henry were gone; the complications of legatine
intervention, avoided only by careful management in Henry’s
later years, led to the most important results in the next
reign; and when the slumbering feud of sceptre and
crozier broke out again, the difference between the cool
Norman temper and the fiery blood of Anjou, between
the saintly self-effacement of Anselm and the lofty self-assertion
of Thomas, was only one of the causes which
gave it such an increase of virulence as brought to nought
the endeavours of king and primate to tread in the steps<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
of those whom they professed to have taken for their
examples.</p>

<p>Of more direct and wide-reaching importance, but less
easy to trace, is the working of Henry’s policy in the temporal
government of England. Like his Church policy,
with which it was in strict accord, it was grounded upon
definite and consistent principles. At the outset of his
reign circumstances had at once compelled the king to
throw himself upon the support of his English subjects and
enabled him to find in them his surest source of strength.
Personally, his sympathies were not a whit more English or
less despotic than those of his predecessor; but, unlike
Rufus, he fairly accepted his position with all its consequences
so far as he understood them, and throughout his
reign he never altogether forsook the standpoint which he
had taken at its beginning. That standpoint, as expressed
in his coronation-charter, was “the law of King Eadward
as amended by King William.” In other words, Henry
pledged himself to carry out his father’s system of compromise
and amalgamation, to take up and continue his father’s
work; and as soon as his hands were free he set himself to
fulfil the pledge. But the scheme whose first outlines had
been sketched by the Conqueror’s master-hand had to be
wrought out under conditions which had changed considerably
since his death and were changing yet farther every day.
The great ecclesiastical question was only the first and most
prominent among a crowd of social and political problems
whose shadows William had at the utmost only seen dimly
looming in the future, but which confronted Henry as present
facts that he must grapple with as best he could. At their
theoretical, systematic solution he made little or no attempt;
the time was not yet ripe, nor was he the man for such
work. He was neither a great legislator nor an original
political thinker, but a clear-headed, sagacious, practical man
of business. Such a man was precisely the ruler needed at
the moment. His reign is not one of the marked eras of
English history; compared with the age which had gone
before and that which came after it, the age of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>
looks almost like a “day of small things.” That very<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>
phrase, which seems so aptly to describe its outward aspect,
warns us not to despise or pass it over lightly. It is just
one of those periods of transition without which the marked
eras would never be. Henry’s mission was to prepare the
way for the work of his grandson by completing that of his
father.</p>

<p>The work was no longer where his father had left it.
When the secular side of the Norman government in England,
somewhat obscured for a while by the ecclesiastical
conflict, comes into distinct view again after the settlement
of 1107, one is almost startled at the amount of developement
which has taken place in the twenty years since the
Conqueror’s death—a developement whose steps lie hidden
beneath the shadows of the Red King’s tyranny and of
Henry’s early struggles. The power of the crown had outgrown
even the nominal restraints preserved from the older
system: the king’s authority was almost unlimited, even in
theory; the Great Council, the successor and representative
of the Witenagemot, had lost all share in the real work of
legislation and government; of the old formula—“counsel
and consent”—the first half had become an empty phrase
and the second a mere matter of course. The assembly
was a court rather than a council, the qualification of its
members, whether earls, barons, or knights, being all alike
dependent on their position as tenants-in-chief of the crown;
the bishops alone kept their unaltered dignity as lineal
successors of the older spiritual Witan; but even the bishops
had been compelled by the compromise of 1107 to hold
their temporalities on the baronial tenure of homage and
fealty to the king, a step which involved the strict application
of the same rule to the lay members of the assembly.
Moreover, the Witenagemot was being gradually supplanted
in all its more important functions by an inner circle of
counsellors, forming a permanent ministerial body which
gathered into its own hands the entire management of the
financial and judicial administration of the state. In one
aspect it was the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curia Regis</span>” or King’s Court, the
supreme court of judicature which appropriated alike the
judicial powers of the Witenagemot, of the old court of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
king’s thegns or <i lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">theningmanna-gemot</i>, and of the feudal
court of the Norman tenants-in-chief. In another aspect it
was the Exchequer, the court which received the royal
revenues from the sheriffs of the counties, arranged and
reviewed the taxation, transacted the whole fiscal business
of the crown, and in short had the supreme control and
management of the “ways and means” of the realm. The
judicial, military and social organization under the Norman
kings rests so completely on a fiscal basis that the working
of the Exchequer furnishes the principal means of studying
that of the whole system; while the connexion between the
functions of the Exchequer and those of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curia Regis</span>
is so close that it is often difficult to draw a line accurately
between them, and all the more so, that they were made up
of nearly the same constituent elements. These were the
great officers of the royal household<span class="nobreak">:—</span>the justiciar, the
treasurer, the chancellor, the constable, the marshal, and
their subordinates<span class="nobreak">:—</span>titles of various origin, some, as for
example the chancellor, being of comparatively recent origin,
while others seem to have existed almost from time immemorial;—but
all titles whose holders, from being mere personal
attendants upon the sovereign, had now become important
officials of the state. Like a crowd of other matters
which first come distinctly to light under Henry, the system
seems to have grown up as it were in the dark during the
reign of William Rufus, no doubt under the hands of Ralf
Flambard. At its head stood the justiciar;—second in
authority to the king in his presence, his representative and
vicegerent in his absence, officially as well as actually his
chief minister and the unquestioned executor of his will.
This office, of which the germs may perhaps be traced as far
back as the time of Ælfred, who acted as “secundarius”
under his brother Æthelred <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, was directly derived from
that which Æthelred <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> had instituted under the title of
high-thegn or high-reeve, and which grew into a permanent
vice-royalty in the persons of Godwine and Harold
under Cnut and Eadward, and of Ralf Flambard under
William Rufus. Ralf himself, a clerk from Bayeux, who
from the position of an obscure dependent in the Conqueror’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
household had made his way by the intriguing, pushing,
unscrupulous temper which had earned him his nickname of
the “Firebrand,” was an upstart whom the barons of the
Conquest may well have despised as much as the native
English feared and hated him. After an interval during
which his office was held by Robert Bloet, bishop of Lincoln—a
former chancellor of the Red King—it passed to a man
who from beginnings almost as lowly as those of Ralf rose to
yet loftier and, it is but fair to add, purer fame. Henry in
his wandering youth, as he rode out from Caen one morning
with a few young companions, stopped to hear mass at a
little wayside chapel. The poor priest who served it, guessing
by their looks the temper of his unexpected congregation,
rattled through the office with a speed which delighted
them; they all pronounced him just the man for a soldier’s
chaplain; Henry enlisted him as such, and soon found that
he had picked up a treasure. Roger became his steward,
and discharged his functions with such care, fidelity and
good management as earned him the entire confidence of
his master.<a id="Anchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 48.">[48]</a> Soon after Henry’s accession he was appointed
chancellor, a post whose duties involved, besides the official
custody of the royal seal, the superintendence of the clerks
of the king’s chapel or chancery, who were charged with
the keeping of the royal accounts, the conducting of the
royal correspondence, the drawing up of writs and other
legal documents and records, and who were now formed into
a trained and organized body serving as secretaries for all
departments of state business. From 1101 to 1106 this
office seems to have been held successively by Roger,
William Giffard, and Waldric; Roger probably resumed it
in 1106 on Waldric’s elevation to the bishopric of Laon,
but if so he resigned it again next year, to become bishop
of Salisbury and justiciar.<a id="Anchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 49.">[49]</a></p>

<p>Henry’s justiciar-bishop was the type of a class. The
impossibility of governing England securely by means of
feudal machinery, even with all the checks and safeguards
which could be drawn from the old English administrative<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
system, had by this time become self-evident. The conduct
of the barons had at once proved to Henry the necessity
and given him the justification for superseding them in
all the more important functions of government, by carrying
out, with a free and strong hand, the scheme which Æthelred <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>
had originated under less favourable circumstances—the
organization of a distinct ministerial body, directly
dependent upon the crown. Of this body the model, as
well as the head, was the bishop of Salisbury. Under his
direction there grew up a trained body of administrators,
most of them clerks like himself, several being his own near
relatives, and almost all upstarts—<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">novi homines</i>, “new men”
in the phrase of the time—compared with the nobles whose
fathers had come over with the Conqueror; forming a sort
of official caste, separate alike from the feudal nobility and
from the mass of the people, and no doubt equally obnoxious
to both, but very much better fitted than any instruments
which either could have furnished for managing the
business of the state at that particular crisis. Over and
above the obloquy which naturally fell upon them as the
instruments of royal justice or royal extortion, there was,
however, another cause for the jealousy with which they
were generally regarded. Henry is charged with showing,
more especially in his later years, a preference for foreigners
which was equally galling to all his native subjects, whatever
their descent might be.<a id="Anchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 50.">[50]</a> It was not that he set Normans
over Englishmen, but that he set men of continental birth
over both alike. The words “Norman” and “English” had
in fact acquired a new meaning since the days of the Conquest.
The sons and grandsons of the men who had come
over with Duke William never lost one spark of their Norman
pride of race; but the land of their fathers was no
longer their home; most of them were born in England,
some had English wives, and even English mothers; to
nearly all, the chief territorial, political and personal interests
of their lives were centred in the island. The constant wars
between the Conqueror’s successors tended still further to
sever the Normans of the duchy from those of the kingdom,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24">24</a></span>
and to drive the latter to unite themselves, at least politically,
with their English fellow-subjects. Already in the
wars of Rufus and Robert the change of feeling shows itself
in the altered use of names; the appellations “Norman”
and “French” are reserved exclusively for the duke and
his allies, and the supporters of the king of England
are all counted together indiscriminately as English.
Tinchebray is distinctly reckoned as an English victory.
From that moment Normandy was regarded, both by its
conquerors and by its French neighbours, as a foreign
dependency of the English crown. Historians on both
sides of the sea, as they narrate the wars between Henry
and Louis of France which arose out of that conquest, unconsciously
shadow forth the truth that the reunion of
England and Normandy really tended to widen the gulf
between them. The greatest French statesman of the day,
Suger, abbot of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Denis, sets the relation between the two
nationalities in the most striking light when he justifies the
efforts of his own sovereign Louis to drive Henry out of the
duchy on the express ground that “Englishmen ought not
to rule over Frenchmen, nor French over English.”<a id="Anchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 51.">[51]</a> One
of our best authorities on the other side, the son of a Frenchman
from Orléans who had come in the train of Roger of
Montgomery and married an English wife—though he spent
his whole life, from the age of ten years, in the Norman
monastery of Saint-Evroul, never ceased to regard his
mother’s country as his own, showed his love for it in the
most touching expressions of remembrance, and took care to
send forth his history to the world under the name of
<em>Orderic the Englishman</em>. This last was no doubt a somewhat
extreme case. Still the fusion between the two races
had clearly begun; it was helped on directly by Henry’s
whole policy, by the impartial character of his internal
administration, by the nature and circumstances of his
relations with his chief continental neighbours, France and
Anjou; indirectly it was helped on by the sense of a
common grievance in the promotion of “strangers”—men
born beyond sea—over the heads of both alike. Slight as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25">25</a></span>
were the bonds between them at present, they were the first
links of a chain which grew stronger year by year; and the
king’s last and grandest stroke of policy, the marriage of his
daughter and destined successor with the count of Anjou,
did more than anything else to quicken the fusion of the
two races by driving them to unite against sovereigns who
were equally aliens from both.</p>

<p>Roger’s great work as justiciar was the organization of
the Exchequer. Twice every year the barons of the Exchequer
met under his presidency around the chequered
table whence they derived their name, and settled accounts
with the sheriffs of the counties. As the sheriffs were
answerable for the entire revenue due to the crown from
their respective shires, the settlement amounted to a
thorough review of the financial condition of the realm.
The profits of the demesne lands and of the judicial proceedings
in the shire-court, now commuted at a fixed sum
under the title of “ferm of the shire”; the land-tax, or as
it was still called, the Danegeld, also compounded for at a
definite rate; the so-called “aids” which in the case of
the towns seem to have corresponded to the Danegeld in
the rural districts; the feudal sources of income, reliefs,
wardships, marriage-dues, escheats; the profits arising out
of the strict and cruel forest-law, the one grievance of his
predecessor’s rule which Henry had from the beginning
refused to redress; all these and many other items found
their places in the exhaustive proceedings of King Henry’s
court of Exchequer. Hand in hand with its financial work
went the judicial work of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curia Regis</span>: a court in
theory comprehending the whole body of tenants-in-chief,
but in practice limited to the great officers of the household
and others specially appointed by the king, and acting
under him, or under the chief justiciar as his representative,
as a supreme tribunal of appeal, and also of first resort in
suits between tenants-in-chief and in a variety of other
cases called up by special writ for its immediate cognisance.
It had moreover the power of acting directly upon the lower
courts in another way. The assessment of taxes was still
based upon the Domesday survey; but transfers of land,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26">26</a></span>
changes in cultivation, the reclaiming of wastes on the one
hand and the creation of new forests on the other, necessarily
raised questions which called for an occasional revision
and readjustment of taxation. This was effected by sending
the judges of the King’s Court—who were only the barons
of the Exchequer in another capacity—on judicial circuits
throughout the country, to hold the pleas of the crown and
settle disputed points of assessment and tenure in the
several shires. As the justices thus employed held their
sittings in the shire-moot, the local and the central judicature
were thus brought into immediate connexion with each
other, and the first stepping-stone was laid towards bridging
over the gap which severed the lower from the higher
organization.</p>

<p>By the establishment of a careful and elaborate administrative
routine Henry and Roger thus succeeded in binding
together all branches of public business and all classes
of society in intimate connexion with and entire dependence
on the crown, through the medium of the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curia Regis</span> and
the Exchequer. The system stands portrayed at full
length in the <cite><i>Dialogue</i></cite> in which Bishop Roger’s great-nephew
expounded the constitution and functions of the
fully developed Court of Exchequer; its working in Roger’s
own day is vividly illustrated in the one surviving record
which has come down to us from that time, the earliest
extant of the “Pipe Rolls” (so called from their shape) in
which the annual statement of accounts was embodied by
the treasurer. The value of this solitary roll of Henry <abbr title="1">I.</abbr>—that
of the year 1130—lies less in the dry bones of the
actual financial statement than in the mass of personal
detail with which they are clothed, and through which we
get such an insight as nothing else can afford into the social
condition of the time. The first impression likely to be
produced by the document is that under Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> and
Roger of Salisbury—“the Lion of Justice” and “the Sword
of Righteousness”—every possible contingency of human
life was somehow turned into a matter of money for the
benefit of the royal treasury. It must, however, be remembered
that except the Danegeld, there was no direct<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27">27</a></span>
taxation; the only means, therefore, of making up a budget
at all was by the feudal levies and miscellaneous incidents;
and these were no longer, as in the Red King’s days, instruments
of unlimited extortion, but were calculated according
to a regular and fairly equitable scale, subject to frequent
modification under special circumstances. Still the items
look strange enough. We see men paying to get into office
and paying to get out of it; heirs paying for the right to
enter upon their inheritance; would-be guardians paying
that they may administer the estates of minors; suitors
paying for leave to marry heiresses or dowered widows;
heiresses and widows paying for freedom to wed the man of
their own choice. The remittances are not always in
money; several of the king’s debtors sent coursing-dogs or
destriers; one has promised a number of falcons, and there
are some amusingly minute stipulations as to their colour.<a id="Anchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 52.">[52]</a>
There is an endless string of land-owners, great and small,
paying for all sorts of privileges connected with their
property; some for leave to make an exchange of land
with a neighbour, some to cancel an exchange already
made; some to procure the speedy determination of a suit
with a rival claimant of their estates, some on the contrary
to delay or avoid answering such a claim, and some
for having themselves put forth claims which they were
unable to prove; the winner pays for his success, the loser
for failing to make good his case; the treasury gains both
ways. Jewish usurers pay for the king’s help in recovering
their debts from his Christian subjects.<a id="Anchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 53.">[53]</a> The citizens
of Gloucester promise thirty marks of silver if the king’s
justice can get back for them a sum of money “which was
taken away from them in Ireland.”<a id="Anchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 54.">[54]</a> This last-quoted entry
brings us at once to another class of items, perhaps the most
interesting of all; those which relate to the growing
liberties of the towns.</p>

<p>The English towns differed completely in their origin
and history from those of the states which had arisen out of
the ruins of the Roman Empire. The great cities of Italy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
and Gaul were daughters of Rome; they were the abiding
depositaries of her social, municipal and political traditions;
as such, they had a vitality and a character which, like their
great mistress and model, they were able to preserve through
all the changes of barbarian conquest and feudal reorganization.
The English towns had no such imperial past; in
their origin and earliest constitution they were absolutely undistinguishable
from the general crowd of little rural settlements
throughout the country. Here and there, for one
reason or another, some particular spot attracted an unusually
large concourse of inhabitants; but whether sheltered within
the walls of a Roman military encampment like Winchester
and York, or planted on the top of an almost immemorial
hill-fort like Old Sarum, or gathered in later days round
some fortress raised for defence against the Welsh or the
Danes like Taunton or Warwick, or round some venerated
shrine like Beverley or Malmesbury or Oxford, still the
settlement differed in nothing but its size from the most
insignificant little group of rustic homesteads which sent its
reeve and four men to the court of the hundred and the
shire. The borough was nothing more than an unusually
large township, generally provided with a dyke and palisade,
or sometimes even a wall, instead of the ordinary quickset
hedge; or it was a cluster of townships which had somehow
coalesced, but without in any way forming an organic whole.
Each unit of the group had its own parish church and
parochial machinery for both spiritual and temporal purposes,
its own assembly for transacting its own internal
affairs; while the general borough-moot, in a town of this
kind, answered roughly to the hundred-court of the rural
districts, and the character of the borough-constitution itself
resembled that of the hundred rather than that of the single
township. The earlier and greater towns must have been
originally free; a few still retain in their common lands a
vestige of their early freedom. But the later towns which
grew up around the hall of a powerful noble, or a great
and wealthy monastery, were dependent from the first upon
the lord of the soil on which they stood; their inhabitants
owed suit and service to the earl, the bishop, or the abbot,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
whichever he might chance to be, and their reeve was
appointed by him. On the other hand, when it became a
recognized principle that everybody must have a lord, and
that all folkland belonged to the king, it followed as a
natural inference that all towns which had no other lord
were counted as royal demesnes, and their chief magistrate
was an officer of the crown. In the great cities he usually
bore the title of <i>port-reeve</i>, a word whose first syllable, though
here used to represent the town in general, refers in strict
etymology to the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">porta</i>, or place where the market was held,
and thus at once points to the element in the life of the
towns which gave them their chief consequence and their
most distinctive character. The Norman conquest had led
to a great increase of their trading importance; a sense of
corporate life and unity grew up within them; their political
position became more clearly defined; they began to recognize
themselves, and to win their recognition at the hands
of the ruling powers, as a separate element in the state.
The distinction was definitely marked by the severance of
their financial interests from those of the shires in which they
stood; a fixed “aid,” varying according to their size and
wealth, was substituted in their case for the theoretically
even, but practically very unfair pressure of the Danegeld;
and to avoid all risk of extortion on the part of the sheriff,
their contribution to the ferm of the shire was settled at a
fixed round sum deducted from the total and accounted for
as a separate item, under the name of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">firma burgi</i>, either by
the sheriff or, in some cases where the privilege had been
specially conferred, by the towns themselves. At the same
time the voluntary institution of the gilds, which had long
acted as a supplement to the loose territorial and legal constitution
of the boroughs, forced its way into greater prominence;
the merchant-gilds made their appearance no longer
as mere private associations, but as legally organized bodies
endowed with authority over all matters connected with
trade in the great mercantile cities; the recognition of their
legal status—generally expressed by the confirmation of the
right to possess a “gild-hall” (or, as it was called in the
north, a “hans-house”)—became a main point in the struggles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
of the towns for privileges and charters. The handicraftsmen,
fired with the same spirit of association, banded themselves
together in like manner; the weavers of London, Huntingdon
and Lincoln, the leather-sellers and weavers of Oxford,
bought of the crown in 1130 a formal confirmation of the
customs of their respective gilds.<a id="Anchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 55.">[55]</a> The lesser towns followed,
as well as they could, the example of the great cities; they
too won from their lords a formal assurance of their privileges;
Archbishop Thurstan’s charter to Beverley was
expressly modelled on that granted by King Henry to
York.<a id="Anchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 56.">[56]</a></p>

<p>We may glance at some of the towns of southern
England in company with some travellers from Gaul who
visited them in the later years of Henry’s reign. The
cathedral church of Laon had been burnt down and its
bishop Waldric slain in a civic tumult in 1112. Waldric
had once been chancellor to King Henry,<a id="Anchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 57.">[57]</a> and the reports
which he and others had brought to Laon of the wealth and
prosperity of the island<a id="Anchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 58.">[58]</a> led some of the canons, after perambulating
northern Gaul to collect donations for the
restoration of their church, to venture beyond sea for the
same object. They set sail from Wissant—seemingly in an
English ship, for its captain bore the English-sounding name
of Coldistan—in company with some Flemish merchants
who were going to buy wool in England, and they landed at
Dover after a narrow escape from some pirates who chased
their vessel in the hope of seizing the money which it was
known to contain.<a id="Anchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 59.">[59]</a> They naturally made their way to
Canterbury first, to enlist the sympathies of the archbishop
and his chapter, as well as those of the scarcely less wealthy
and powerful abbey of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Augustine.<a id="Anchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 60.">[60]</a> Thence they apparently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
proceeded to Winchester.<a id="Anchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 61.">[61]</a> The old West-Saxon
capital had lost its ancient rank; London, which had long
surpassed it in commercial and political importance, had
now superseded it as the crowning-place and abode of kings.
But its connexion with the crown was far from being
broken. Its proximity to the New Forest made it a
favourite residence of the Conqueror and his sons; William
himself had built not only a castle on the high ground at
the western end of the city, just below the west gate of the
Roman enclosure, but also a palace in its south-eastern
quarter, hard by the cathedral and the New Minster; it was
here that he usually held his Easter court, and his successors
continued the practice. One very important department of
the royal administration, moreover, was still permanently
centred at Winchester—the Treasury, which under its
English title of the “Hoard” had been settled there by
Eadward the Confessor, and which seems not to have been
finally transferred to Westminster till late in the reign of
Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr><a id="Anchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 62.">[62]</a> Of the two great religious foundations, one, the
“Old Minster,” or cathedral church of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Swithun, the
crowning-place and burial-place of our native kings, assumed
under the hands of its first Norman bishop the aspect which,
outwardly at least, it still retains. The other, the “New
Minster,” so strangely placed by Ælfred close beside the old
one, had incurred William’s wrath by the deeds of its abbot
and some of its monks who fought and fell at Senlac; to
punish the brotherhood, he planted his palace close against
the west front of their church; and they found their position
so intolerable that in 1111, by Henry’s leave, they
migrated outside the northern boundary of Winchester to a
new abode which grew into a wealthy and flourishing house
under the name of Hyde Abbey, leaving their old home to
fall into decay and to be represented in modern days by a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
quiet graveyard.<a id="Anchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 63.">[63]</a> As a trading centre Winchester ranked
in Henry’s day, and long after, second to London alone; the
yearly fair which within living memory was held on <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Giles’s day upon the great hill to the east of the city<a id="Anchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 64.">[64]</a> preserved
a faint reminiscence of the vast crowds of buyers and
sellers who flocked thither from all parts of the country
throughout the middle ages.</p>

<p>At the opposite end of the New Forest the little town
of Twinham, or Christchurch as it was beginning to be
called from its great ecclesiastical establishment, whose
church had been rebuilt on a grand scale by Ralf Flambard,
had, on the octave of Pentecost, a fair which the travellers
took care to attend, much to the disgust of the dean, who
was anxious to secure all the offerings of the assembled
crowd for the improvement of his own church, and had no
mind to share them with our Lady of Laon.<a id="Anchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 65.">[65]</a> They met
with a warmer welcome at Exeter at the hands of its archdeacon
and future bishop Robert.<a id="Anchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 66.">[66]</a> In the next reign
Exeter was counted as the fourth city in the kingdom.<a id="Anchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 67.">[67]</a>
Natural wealth of its own it had none; the bare rocky soil
of the south coast of Devon produced nothing but a few
oats, and those of the poorest quality;<a id="Anchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 68.">[68]</a> but the mouth of
the Exe furnished a safe and convenient anchorage for small
merchant vessels either from Gaul or from Ireland, and
though Bristol was fast drawing away this latter branch of
her trade, Exeter could still boast of “such an abundance
of merchandise that nothing required for the use of man
could ever be asked for there in vain.”<a id="Anchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 69.">[69]</a> It was far otherwise
with Salisbury, to which the travellers were probably
drawn chiefly by the fame of its bishop;<a id="Anchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 70.">[70]</a> the Salisbury of
those days was not the city in the plain which now spreads<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
itself around the most perfect of English Gothic minsters,
but the city whose traces, in a very dry summer, may still
now and then be seen in the fields which cover the hill of
Old Sarum. Crowded as it was into that narrow circle—narrow,
and without possibility of enlargement—Bishop
Roger’s Salisbury was an excellent post for military security,
but it had no chance of attaining industrial or commercial
importance, although he did not disdain to accept the grant
of its market tolls, which till 1130 formed part of the ferm
of Wilton.<a id="Anchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 71.">[71]</a> Wilton was apparently still the chief town of
the shire to which it had originally given its name; like
Christchurch it had its fair, but, like Christchurch too, its
importance was mainly derived from its abbey, where the
memory of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Eadgyth or Edith, a daughter of Eadgar, was
venerated by English and Normans alike, by none more
than the queen who shared Eadgyth’s royal blood and had
once borne her name.<a id="Anchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 72.">[72]</a> The visitors from Laon, however,
seem to have been more impressed by another name which
one is somewhat startled to meet in this southern region—that
of Bæda, whose tomb was shown them in the abbey
church of Wilton, and was believed to be the scene of
miraculous cures.<a id="Anchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 73.">[73]</a> They retraced their steps into Devonshire,
where they found the legends of Arthur as rife among
the people as they were among the Bretons of Gaul; they
were shown the chair and oven of the “blameless king,” and
a tumult nearly arose at Bodmin out of a dispute between
one of their party and a man who persisted in asserting
that Arthur was still alive.<a id="Anchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 74.">[74]</a> After visiting Barnstaple and
Totnes<a id="Anchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 75.">[75]</a> they turned northward towards the greatest seaport
of the west, and indeed, with one exception, of all England:
Bristol.</p>

<p>To trace out the Bristol of the twelfth century in the
Bristol of to-day is a matter of difficulty not only from the
enormous growth of the town, but from the changes which
have taken place in the physical conformation of its site.
Nominally, it still stands on the peninsula formed by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
junction of the Frome and the Avon; but the courses of
both rivers have been so altered and disguised that the
earlier aspect of the place is very hard to realize. The
original Bristol stood wholly upon the high ground which
now forms the neck of the peninsula, then a small tongue
of land surrounded on the south-east by the Avon, on the
north, west and south by the Frome, which flowed round
it almost in the form of a horse-shoe and fell into the Avon
on the southern side of the town, just below the present
Bristol Bridge.<a id="Anchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 76.">[76]</a> Before the Norman conquest, it seems, the
lower course of the Frome had already been diverted from
its natural bed;<a id="Anchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 77.">[77]</a> its present channel was not dug till the
middle of the thirteenth century, across a wide expanse of
marsh stretching all along the right bank of both rivers, and
flooded every day by the tide which came rushing up the
estuary of Severn almost to the walls of the town, and made
it seem like an island in the sea.<a id="Anchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 78.">[78]</a> Within its comparatively
narrow limits Bristol must have been in general character
and aspect not unlike what it is to-day—a busy, bustling,
closely-packed city, full of the eager, active, surging life of
commercial enterprise. Ostmen from Waterford and Dublin,
Northmen from the Western Isles and the more distant
Orkneys, and even from Norway itself, had long ago learnt
to avoid the shock of the “Higra,” the mighty current which
still kept its heathen name derived from the sea-god of their
forefathers,<a id="Anchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 79.">[79]</a> and make it serve to float them into the safe
and commodious harbour of Bristol, where a thousand ships
could ride at anchor.<a id="Anchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 80.">[80]</a> As the great trading centre of the
west Bristol ranked as the third city in the kingdom,<a id="Anchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 81.">[81]</a>
surpassed in importance only by Winchester and London.
The most lucrative branch of its trade, however, reflects no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
credit on its burghers. All the eloquence of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Wulfstan
and all the sternness of the Conqueror had barely availed
to check for a while their practice of kidnapping men for
the Irish slave-market; and that the traffic was again in
full career in the latter years of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> we learn from the
experiences of the canons of Laon. They eagerly went on
board some of the vessels in the harbour to buy some clothes,
and to inspect the strange wares brought from lands which
can have had little or no intercourse with the inland cities
of Gaul. On their return they were solemnly implored by
their friends in the city not to run such a risk again, as they
would most likely find the ships suddenly put to sea and
themselves sold into bondage in a foreign land.<a id="Anchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 82.">[82]</a></p>

<p>No such dangers awaited them at Bath. With their
reception there by the bishop<a id="Anchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 83.">[83]</a>—whom the healing virtues
of its waters had induced first to remove his bishopstool
thither from its lowlier seat at Wells, and then to buy the
whole city of King Henry for the sum of five hundred
pounds<a id="Anchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 84.">[84]</a>—their itinerary comes to an abrupt end. If they
penetrated no further up the Severn valley than Bristol they
turned back from the gates of a region which was then
reckoned the fairest and wealthiest in England. The vale
of Gloucester is described as a sort of earthly paradise, where
the soil brought forth of its own accord the most abundant
and choicest fruits, where from one year’s end to another the
trees were never bare, where the apples hung within reach of
the traveller’s hand as he walked along the roads;—above
all, where the fruit of the vine, which in other parts of
England was mostly sour, yielded a juice scarcely inferior to
the wines of Gaul. Another source of wealth was supplied
by the fisheries of the great river, the fertilizer as well as the
highway of this favoured district. Religion and industry,
abbeys and towns, grew and flourished by Severn-side.<a id="Anchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 85.">[85]</a>
Worcester was still the head of the diocese; but in political
rank it had had to give way to Gloucester. Standing lower<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
down the river, Gloucester was more accessible for trade,
while its special importance as the key of the South-Welsh
border had made it one of the recognized places for assemblies
of the court from the time of the Danish kings. The
chief town of the neighbouring valley of the Wye, Hereford,
had once been a border-post of yet greater importance; but
despite its castle and its bishop’s see, it was now a city “of
no great size,” whose broken-down ramparts told the story
of a greatness which had passed away.<a id="Anchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 86.">[86]</a></p>

<p>Far different was the case of Chester. What the estuary
of the Severn was to the southern part of western England,
that of the Dee was to its northern part; Chester was at
once the Bristol and the Gloucester of the north-west coast—the
centre of its trade and its bulwark against the Welsh.
Beyond the Dee there was as yet little sign of industrial life.
Cultivation had made little or no progress among the moorland
and forest-tracts of western Yorkshire, and its eastern
half had not yet recovered from the harrying with which the
Conqueror had avenged its revolt in 1068. For more than
sixty miles around York the ground still lay perfectly bare.
“Cities whose walls once rose up to heaven—tracts that
were once well watered, smiling meadows—if a stranger sees
them now, he groans; if a former inhabitant could see them,
he would not recognize his home.” The one thing which
had survived this ruin was, as ever, the work of the Roman.<a id="Anchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 87.">[87]</a>
York still kept its unbroken life, its ecclesiastical primacy, its
commercial greatness; the privileges of its merchants were
secured by a charter from the king; they had their gild
with its “alderman” at its head,<a id="Anchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 88.">[88]</a> their “hans-house” for the
making of bye-laws and the transaction of all gild business;
and they were freed from all tolls throughout the shire.<a id="Anchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 89.">[89]</a>
Far to the north-west, on the Scottish border, Carlisle, after
more than two centuries of ruin, had been restored and
repeopled by William Rufus. The city had been destroyed
by the Danes in 875, and its site remained utterly desolate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
till in 1092 the Red King drove out an English thegn who
occupied it under the protection of Malcolm of Scotland, and
reunited it to the English realm.<a id="Anchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 90.">[90]</a> The place still kept some
material relics of its earlier past; fragments of its Roman
walls were still there, to be used up again in the new fortifications
with which the Red King encircled his conquest; and
some years later the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">triclinium</i> of one of its Roman houses called
forth the admiring wonder of a southern visitor, William of
Malmesbury.<a id="Anchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 91.">[91]</a> But the city and the surrounding country
lay almost void of inhabitants, and only the expedient of a
colony sent by Rufus from southern England, “to dwell in
the land and till it,”<a id="Anchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 92.">[92]</a> brought the beginnings of a new life.
Yet before the end of Henry’s reign, that life had grown so
vigorous that the archbishop of York found himself unable
to make adequate provision for its spiritual needs, and was
glad to sanction the formation of Carlisle and its district
into a separate diocese.</p>

<p>The chief importance of Carlisle was in its military
character, as an outpost of defence against the Scots. On
the opposite coast we see springing up, around a fortress
originally built for the same purpose, the beginning of an
industrial community at Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The “customs”
of the town contain provisions for the regulation of
both inland and outland trade; if a merchant vessel put in
at the mouth of the Tyne, the burghers may buy what they
will; if a dispute arise between one of them and a foreign
merchant, it must be settled before the tide has ebbed thrice;
the foreign trader may carry his wares ashore for sale, except
salt and herrings, which must be sold on board the ship.
No merchant, save a burgher, may buy wool, hides, or any
other merchandise outside the town, nor within it, except
from burghers; and no one but a burgher may buy, make,
or cut cloth for dyeing.<a id="Anchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 93.">[93]</a> Round the minster of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> John of

the soil, Archbishop Thurstan of York, a charter whose privileges
were copied from those of the metropolitan city itself.
As a whole, however, the north was still a wild region,
speaking a tongue of which, as William of Malmesbury complained,
“we southrons could make nothing,” and living a
life so unconnected with that of southern England that even
King Henry still thought it needful to reinforce his ordinary
body-guard with a troop of auxiliaries whenever he crossed
the Humber.<a id="Anchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 94.">[94]</a></p>

<p>This isolation was in great part due to physical causes.
What is now the busy West Riding was then mainly a vast
tract of moor and woodland, stretching from Wakefield to
the Peak and from the Westmoreland hills to the sources of
the Don; while further east, the district between the lower
course of the Don and that of the Trent was one wide
morass. Such obstacles were still strong enough to hinder,
though not to bar, the intercourse of Yorkshire with mid-England.
The only safe line of communication was the
Foss Way, which struck across the central plain and along
the eastern side of the Trent valley to Lincoln, and thence
turned north-westward to cross the Trent and wind round
between forest and fen to York. Lincoln was thus the
chief station on the highway between York and the south.
Under the Norman rule the city had risen to a new importance.
Two of its quarters had been entirely transformed;
the south-western was now covered by a castle, and
the south-eastern by a cathedral church. Neither building
was the first of its kind which had occupied the spot. Few
sites in England could have been more attractive to a
soldier’s eye than the crest of the limestone ridge descending
abruptly to the south into a shallow sort of basin,
watered by the little river Witham, and on the west sloping
gradually down to a broad alluvial swamp extending as far
as the bank of the Trent. The hundred and sixty-six
houses which the Conqueror swept away to make room for
his castle<a id="Anchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 95.">[95]</a> were but encroachments on an earlier fortification,
a “work” of mounds and earthen ramparts of the usual old<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
English type, which now served as a foundation for his walls
of stone.<a id="Anchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 96.">[96]</a> To the ardent imagination of the medieval Church,
on the other hand, the rocky brow of Lincoln might well
seem to cry out for a holier crown, and a church of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mary
was already in existence<a id="Anchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 97.">[97]</a> on the site where Bishop Remigius
of Dorchester, forsaking his lowly home in the valley of the
Thames, reared his bishopstool amid the foundations of that
great minster of our Lady whose noble group of towers now
rises on the crest of the hill as a beacon to all the country
round.<a id="Anchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 98.">[98]</a> But there were other reasons for the translation of
the bishopric than those of sentiment or of personal taste.
Of the vast Mid-Anglian diocese, which stretched from the
Thames to the Humber, Lincoln was beyond all comparison
the most important town. Even in Roman times the
original quadrangular enclosure of <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lindum Colonia</span> had been
found too small, and a fortified suburb had spread down to
the left bank of the Witham. During the years of peace
which lasted from the accession of Cnut to that of William,
the needs of an increasing population, as we have seen,
covered the site of the older fortress with dwellings: when
these were cleared away at William’s bidding, their exiled
inhabitants found a new home on a plot of hitherto waste
ground beyond the river; and a new town, untrammelled by
the physical obstacles which had cramped the growth of the
city on the hill, sprang up around the two churches of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Mary-le-Wigford and <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Peter-at-Gowts.<a id="Anchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 99.">[99]</a> Some fifty years
later Lincoln was counted one of the most populous and
flourishing cities in England.<a id="Anchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 100.">[100]</a> The roads which met on the
crest of its hill to branch off again in all directions formed
only one of the ways by which trade poured into its market.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Not only had the now dirty little stream of Witham a tide
strong enough to bring the small merchant vessels of the
day quite up to the bridge: it was connected with the
Trent at Torksey by a canal, probably of Roman origin,
known as the Foss Dyke; this after centuries of neglect
was cleared out and again made navigable by order of
Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>,<a id="Anchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 101.">[101]</a> and through it there flowed into Lincoln a still
more extensive trade from the lower Trent Valley and the
Humber. The “men of the city and the merchants of the
shire” were already banded together in a merchant-gild;<a id="Anchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 102.">[102]</a>
and it is doubtless this gild which is represented by the
“citizens of Lincoln” who in 1130 paid two hundred
marks of silver and four marks of gold for the privilege of
holding their city in chief of the king.<a id="Anchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 103.">[103]</a></p>

<p>The removal of Bishop Remigius from Dorchester to
Lincoln was in accordance with a new practice, which had
come in since the Norman conquest, of placing the episcopal
see in the chief town of the diocese. The same motive had
prompted a translation of the old Mercian bishopric from
Lichfield, now described as “a little town in the woodland,
with a rivulet flowing by it, far away from the throng of
cities,”<a id="Anchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 104.">[104]</a> to Chester, whence, however, it was soon removed
again to the great abbey of Coventry.<a id="Anchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 105.">[105]</a> The same reason,
too, caused Norwich to succeed Thetford as the seat of the
bishopric of East-Anglia. It was but very recently that
Lincoln had outstripped Norwich as the chief city of eastern
England. The mouth of the Yare, which had a tideway
navigation quite up to the point where the Wensum falls
into it, was no less conveniently placed than that of the
Witham for intercourse with northern Europe; and the
Scandinavian traders and settlers in the first half of the
eleventh century had raised Norwich to such a pitch of
prosperity that at the coming of the Norman it contained
twenty-four churches, and its burghers seem to have been
more numerous than those of any town in the realm<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
except London and York.<a id="Anchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 106.">[106]</a> Twenty years later their number
was indeed greatly diminished; the consequences of Earl
Ralf’s rebellion had wrought havoc in the city. But if its
native population had decreased, a colony of Norman
burghers was growing up and flourishing in a “new borough,”
now represented by the parishes of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Peter Mancroft and
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Giles; the number of churches and chapels had risen to
forty-four,<a id="Anchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 107.">[107]</a> and in the Red King’s last years the foundations

<p>It was, however, in the valley of the Thames that
English town-life was growing up most vigorously. Tried
by the test of statistics, indeed, Oxford was still but a small
place; in the time of the Confessor it had only contained
about a thousand dwellings, and before the Domesday survey
was made the town had, through some unexplained cause,
suffered such decay that more than half of these were waste.<a id="Anchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 111.">[111]</a>
But the “waste” was quickly repaired under the wise
government of Robert of Oilly, to whom the chief command
at Oxford was entrusted by the Conqueror, and of his
nephew and namesake who succeeded to his office. Before
the close of Henry’s reign every side of that marvellously
varied life of Oxford which makes its history seem like an
epitome of the history of all England was already in existence,
though only in germ. The military capabilities of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42">42</a></span>
the site, recognized long ago by Eadward the Elder, had
been carefully strengthened; within the natural protection
of its encircling rivers, the town was “closely girt about with
rampart and ditch,”<a id="Anchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 112.">[112]</a> and the mound, raised probably by
Eadward himself, at its western end had been made the
nucleus of a mighty fortress which was soon to become famous
in the struggle of Stephen and Matilda.<a id="Anchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 113.">[113]</a> Nor was fortification
the sole care of the D’Oillys; within and without the
city, works of piety and of public utility sprang up under
their direction. The ancient ford which had given the
town a name was no longer the sole means of crossing the
network of streams which fenced it in on every side save
one; the High Bridge of our own day represents one built
by the first Robert of Oilly.<a id="Anchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 114.">[114]</a> Of the sixteen churches and
chapels which Oxford now contained,<a id="Anchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 115.">[115]</a> <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> George’s-in-the-Castle
was certainly and <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Peter’s-in-the-East probably
founded by him;<a id="Anchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 116.">[116]</a> several of the older parish churches which
had fallen into decay were restored at his expense;<a id="Anchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 117.">[117]</a> and
those of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Michael and <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mary the Virgin, as well as that
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mary Magdalene without the walls, were all founded
in his time or in that of his nephew, if not actually by their
munificence.<a id="Anchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 118.">[118]</a> One of these, <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mary the Virgin, was to
become famous in after-days as the University church. As
yet, the centre of intellectual life at Oxford was the ancient
monastery of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Fritheswith or Frideswide, which after many
vicissitudes had finally passed into the hands of the Austin
canons,<a id="Anchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 119.">[119]</a> and entered upon a new career of prosperity under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43">43</a></span>
its learned prior Guimund, the builder of the beautiful church
which now stands hidden away beneath the later splendours
of Christ Church, like a buried and yet living relic of an
earlier and simpler age. Even <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Frideswide’s, however,
had a formidable rival in the priory of Oseney which the
younger Robert of Oilly founded, also for Austin canons, in
the island-meadow overlooked by his castle-tower.<a id="Anchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 120.">[120]</a> The
Augustinians were a new order whose rise was closely associated
with the revival of intellectual and social culture;
their houses were the best schools of the time—schools in
which the scholars were trained for secular no less than for
clerical careers—and their presence at Oseney and <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Frideswide’s
was already preparing the intellectual soil of Oxford
to receive, at the close of Henry’s reign, the seeds of the
first English University in the divinity lectures of Robert
Pulein.<a id="Anchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 121.">[121]</a> The burgher-life of the city had long gathered
round the church of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin; in its churchyard was held
the portmannimot or general assembly of the citizens; they
had their merchant-gild and their gild-hall;<a id="Anchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 122.">[122]</a> they had their
common pasture-land,<a id="Anchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 123.">[123]</a> the wide green “Port-meadow”
beyond the Isis; and we see the growth of a local industry
in the appearance of the leather-sellers’ and weavers’ gilds.
Shortly before Henry’s death, there were indications that
Oxford was soon to regain the political position which it
had held under the old English and Danish kings, but had
entirely lost since their time. A strange legacy of awe had
been left to the city by its virgin patroness. The story
went that Fritheswith, flying from the pursuit of her royal
lover, sank down exhausted at the gate, and, despairing of
further escape, called upon Heaven itself to check him; as
he entered the town he was struck blind, and though her
prayers afterwards restored his sight, no king after him
dared set foot within the boundaries of Oxford for fear of
incurring some similar punishment.<a id="Anchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 124.">[124]</a> It must be supposed
that the councils held at Oxford under Æthelred and Cnut<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44">44</a></span>
met outside the walls; we cannot tell whether any countenance
was given to the legend by the circumstances of
Harald Harefoot’s death; but from that time forth we hear
of no more royal visits to Oxford till 1133—the very year
of Robert Pulein’s lectures. Then we find that Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>,
whose favourite country residence was at Woodstock, had
been so drawn to the neighbouring town as to build himself
a “new hall” there,<a id="Anchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 125.">[125]</a> just outside the northern wall, on the
ground afterwards known as Beaumont-fields. He held but
one festival there, the last Easter which he ever spent in
England; but each in turn of the rival candidates for the
throne left vacant by his death found Oxford ready to become
a political as well as a military centre of scarcely less
importance than London itself.</p>

<p>Our great picture of medieval London belongs in all its
completeness to a somewhat later date; it was painted in
the closing years of the twelfth century. But, as in the case
of so many other things which only come out into full light
under Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, although the colouring and the details may
belong more especially to his time, the main features were
already there in the time of his grandfather. The outline
of the city was a sort of irregular half-ellipse, fenced in upon
the northern or land side by a girdle of massive walls
pierced with gates and fortified with lofty towers; the wall
on the south side, being built close upon the river bank, was
gradually washed away by the ebb and flow of the tide constantly
beating upon its foundations. On this side the
river itself was an all-sufficient protection. The eastern
extremity of the city, where the wall came down towards
the water’s edge, was guarded by a mighty fortress, founded
by King William in the earliest days of his conquest to hold
his newly-won capital in check, and always known by the
emphatic name of “the Tower.” The western end was
protected by two lesser fortresses,<a id="Anchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 126.">[126]</a>—Castle Baynard and
Montfichet, whose sokes filled up the space between the
cathedral precincts and the city wall. Another, which must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
have stood in the same neighbourhood, seems to have been
partly destroyed by the fire which ravaged London a few
months before the Conqueror’s death, and in which the
cathedral of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Paul entirely perished.<a id="Anchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 127.">[127]</a> Part of the ditch of
this fortress was surrendered by King Henry to make room
for a wall with which Bishop Richard was now enclosing
his precincts;<a id="Anchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 128.">[128]</a> while within this enclosure a new church,
gorgeous with all the latest developements of Norman architectural
skill, was now fast approaching completion.<a id="Anchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 129.">[129]</a> <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Paul’s was the rallying-point, as it had been the nucleus, of
municipal life in London. In time of peace the folkmoot
assembled at the eastern end of its churchyard at the
summons of its great bell; in time of war the armed
burghers gathered at its west door and beneath its banner,
with the lord of Baynard’s castle as their standard-bearer.<a id="Anchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 130.">[130]</a>
The internal constitution of London, however, was scarcely
a town-constitution of any kind; it was more like an epitome
of the organization of all England. The ordinary system of
the parish and the township, the special franchises and jurisdictions
of the great individual landowners, of the churches,
of the gilds—all these were loosely bundled together under
the general headship of the bishop and the port-reeve, to
whom King William addressed his one surviving English
writ, just as he would have addressed the bishop and sheriff
of a county. The writ itself merely confirmed to the
citizens “all the law whereof they had been worthy in King
Eadward’s day”;<a id="Anchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 131.">[131]</a> but by the end of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>’s reign the
Londoners had got far beyond this. By virtue of a royal
charter, they had exchanged their regally-appointed port-reeve
for a sheriff of their own choice, and this officer served<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
at once for the city and for the shire of Middlesex, which
was granted in ferm to the citizens for ever, as the other
shires were granted year by year to their respective sheriffs;
they were exempted from all tolls and mercantile dues
throughout the realm, and from suit and service to all courts
outside their own walls, even the pleas of the crown being
intrusted to a special justiciar elected by themselves. Yet
there was no complete civic organization; the charter confirmed
all the old separate jurisdictions and franchises, the
various “sokens” and “customs” of churches, barons and
burghers, the wardmoots or assemblies of the different
parishes or townships, as well as the husting or folkmoot in
which all were gathered together,<a id="Anchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 132.">[132]</a>—and left London as it
found it, not a compact, symmetrical municipality, but, as
it has been truly called, simply “a shire covered with
houses.”</p>

says that this fortress “stood, as it may seem, where now standeth

stood on the right bank of the Fleet, separated from <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Paul’s by the course
of that river and the whole width of the soke of Castle Baynard, so that the gift of
the ditch of a castle on its site would have been perfectly useless for the enlargement
of the precincts.

<p>This mass of growing life lay chiefly north-east of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Paul’s, where a crowd of lesser churches, conventual and
parochial, rose out of a network of close-packed streets and
alleys thronged with busy craftsmen and noisy, chaffering
traders. Through the heart of it flowed the “Wall-brook,” on
whose bank there lingered, long after the stream itself was
buried and built over, a tradition of the barges laden with
merchandise which were towed up from the Thames to
a landing-place at the eastern end of the Cheap.<a id="Anchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 133.">[133]</a> Beyond
the Walbrook lay the East-Cheap, almost busier and more
crowded still; while to the north, along the upper course of
the Walbrook, was a thriving Jewish quarter.<a id="Anchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 134.">[134]</a> Population
was spreading, too, beyond the walls. Many of the wealthier
citizens dwelt in pleasant suburban houses, surrounded with
bright gardens and shady trees.<a id="Anchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 135.">[135]</a> Some two miles higher up
the river, the populous suburb of Westminster clustered
round the famous abbey built in honour of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Peter by the
last Old-English king, and the palace of William Rufus, a
splendid edifice with a breast-work and bastion stretching<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
down to the water’s edge.<a id="Anchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 136.">[136]</a> North-west of the city, just outside
the wall, lay the plain of Smithfield, where a great
horse-fair was held every Friday.<a id="Anchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 137.">[137]</a> Beyond was an expanse
of fruitful tillage-lands and rich pastures, watered by running
streams and made merry with the rush of countless watermills;<a id="Anchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 138.">[138]</a>
and this tract was sheltered by a wide belt of woodland
stretching away across the northern part of Middlesex
to the foot of the Chiltern Hills. Here the stag and the
fallow-deer, the boar and the wild bull, had their coverts,
beside a multitude of lesser game; all of which the citizens
were by a special privilege entitled to hunt at their pleasure.<a id="Anchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 139.">[139]</a>
Such quasi-regal sport was doubtless only enjoyed by the
greater and wealthier among them; the mass of the young
burghers were content, in the summer evenings when their
day’s work was done, with a saunter among the shady
gardens and fresh springs which enlivened the northern
suburbs; while in winter their favourite resort was a tract of
low-lying moor or marsh—the Moorfields of later times—on
whose frozen surface they could enjoy to their heart’s
content the exercises of sliding, sledging and skating.<a id="Anchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 140.">[140]</a>
Business, pleasure, piety, intellectual culture, all had their
places in the vigorous life of the great city. Each of the
two great minsters, <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Paul’s and <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Peter’s, had a school
attached to it, and so had the abbey of our Lady at Bermondsey,
just over the water.<a id="Anchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 141.">[141]</a> Money-getting did not
absorb all the energies of the burghers; “they were respected
and noted above all other citizens for their manners, dress,
table and discourse.”<a id="Anchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 142.">[142]</a> “Moreover, almost all the bishops,
abbots and great men of England are, in a manner, citizens
and freemen of London; as they have magnificent houses
there, to which they resort, spending large sums of money,
whenever they are summoned thither to councils and assemblies
by the king or their metropolitan, or are compelled to
go there by their own business.”<a id="Anchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 143.">[143]</a> And between these visitors
and the resident citizens there was no hard and fast line of
demarcation. Neither the knight-errant’s blind contempt
for practical industry nor the still blinder contempt of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
merely practical man for everything which has not its value
in hard cash had as yet come into existence. Under the
old English system the merchant who had made three
long voyages over sea on his own account was entitled to
rank as a thegn, and to take his place among the nobles
of the land. Under the Norman system a link between
the two classes was supplied by the citizens of Norman
origin, to whom London in no small measure owed
the marked importance which it attained under Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>
The Norman knights had no monopoly of the enterprizing
spirit of their race; the victorious host had
scarcely settled down upon the conquered soil when it was
followed by a second invasion of a very different character.
Merchants, traders, craftsmen of all sorts, came flocking to
seek their fortunes in their sovereign’s newly-acquired
dominions, not by forcible spoliation of the native people,
but by fair traffic and honest labour in their midst. The
fusion of races in this class, the class of which the town
population chiefly consisted, began almost from the first years
of the conquest. The process was very likely more helped
than hindered by the grinding tyranny which united all the
Red King’s victims in a community of suffering; but its
great working-out was in the reign of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> His restoration
of law and order, his administrative and judicial
reforms, gave scope for a great outburst of industrial and
commercial energy. England under him had her heavy
burthens and her cruel grievances; they stand out plainly
enough in the complaints of her native chronicler. But to
men who lived amidst the endless strife of the French
kingdom or the Flemish border-land, or of the Norman
duchy under the nominal government of Robert Curthose,
a country where “no man durst misdo with other,” and where
the sovereign “made peace for man and deer,”<a id="Anchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 144.">[144]</a> may well
have looked like a sort of earthly paradise. It is no wonder
that peaceable citizens who only wanted to be quiet and
get an honest living came across the sea to find shelter and
security in the rich and prosperous island. For settlers of
this kind it was easy enough to make a home. No gulf of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
hatred and suspicion, no ever-present sense of wrong suffered
and wrong done, stood fixed between them and their
English fellow-burghers. Even before the Conqueror’s
reign had closed, English and Normans were living contentedly
side by side in all the chief cities of England:
sometimes, as we have noticed in the case of Norwich, the
new-comers dwelt apart in a suburb or quarter of their own,
but the distinction was one of locality only; the intercourse
was perfectly free and perfectly amicable; Norman refinement,
Norman taste, Norman fashions, especially in dress,
made their way rapidly among the English burghers; and
intermarriages soon became frequent.<a id="Anchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 145.">[145]</a> In the great cities,
where the sight of foreign traders was nothing new or strange,
and the barriers of prejudice and ignorance of each other’s
languages had been worn away by years of commercial
intercourse, the fusion was naturally more easy; in London,
whither the “men of Rouen” had come in their “great ships,”
with their cargoes of wine or sturgeons,<a id="Anchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 146.">[146]</a> long before their
countrymen came with bow and spear and sword, it was
easiest of all. The great commercial centre to which the
Norman merchants had long been attracted as visitors
attracted them as settlers now that it had become the capital
of their own sovereign; and the attraction grew still stronger
during the unquiet times in Normandy which followed the
Conqueror’s death. “Many natives of the chief Norman
cities, Rouen and Caen, removed to London, and chose them
out a dwelling there, because it was a fitter place for their
trade, and better stored with the goods in which they were
wont to deal.”<a id="Anchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 147.">[147]</a></p>

<p>That the influence of these Norman burghers was dominant
in the city there can be little doubt; but they seem to
have won their predominance by fair means and to have
used it fairly. If they, as individuals, prospered in the
English capital, they contributed their full share to its corporate
prosperity, and indirectly to that of the nation at
large. They brought a great deal more than mere wealth;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
they brought enterprize, vigour, refinement, culture, social
as well as political progress. In their pleasant, cheerful,
well-ordered dwellings many a noble knight or baron
may have been glad to accept a hospitality such as
his own stately but comfortless and desolate castle could
never afford; many a learned and dignified ecclesiastic
may have enjoyed a refinement of society such as he
could rarely hope to meet among the rough and
reckless swordsmen with whom the ranks of the high-born
laity were filled. We are not dependent on mere general
statements; we can do as did these barons and prelates themselves;
we can go with them to visit the home of a typical
London citizen of the early twelfth century. In the heart
of the busiest trading quarter, on the spot where Mercer’s
Hall now stands in Cheapside, under the shadow of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mary
Colechurch, and well within sound of the bells of the more
famous <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mary-at-Bow, was the house of Gilbert Becket and
Rohesia his wife. When their son, grown to manhood and
high in office, was asked of his origin and extraction, he
answered simply that his parents were citizens of London,
dwelling blameless and respected among their fellow-burghers.<a id="Anchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 148.">[148]</a>
Had not the inquisitive zeal of his biographers led
them to search more closely into his pedigree, we might never
have known that his father and mother were foreigners—Gilbert,
born at Rouen, of a respectable burgher family;
Rohesia, sprung from the same rank of life at Caen.<a id="Anchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 149.">[149]</a>
Gilbert once filled the office of port-reeve of London,<a id="Anchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 150.">[150]</a> and bore a
high character for intelligence, industry and upright dealing.
Rohesia was the pattern of wives and mothers. Her
domestic affections and her wider Christian sympathies, her
motherly love and her charity to the needy, are seen exquisitely
blended together in her habit of weighing her little
son at stated intervals against money, clothes and food
which she gave to the poor, trusting thereby to bring a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
blessing on the child.<a id="Anchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 151.">[151]</a> As soon as he was old enough, he
was sent to school at Merton Priory in Surrey,<a id="Anchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 152.">[152]</a> where his
father seems to have been treated as a friend by the prior;
and when the boy came home for his holidays, it was to
spend them in riding and hawking with Richer de L’Aigle,
a young knight sprung from one of the noblest families of
Normandy, and a constant visitor and intimate friend of the
little household in Cheapside.<a id="Anchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 153.">[153]</a> It is plain from the simple,
matter-of-fact way in which that household is described that
it in nowise differed from the generality of burgher-households
around it. Its head was wealthy, but not to such a
degree as to excite special notice or envy; he and his wife
lived in comfort and affluence, but only such as befitted their
station; they seem to have been in no way distinguished from
the bulk of respectable, well-to-do, middle-class citizens of
their day. The one peculiarity of their home was the circumstance
to which we owe our knowledge of its character
and its history<span class="nobreak">:—</span>that in it had been born a child who was
to begin his career as Thomas of London the burgher’s son,
and to end it as Thomas of Canterbury, archbishop, saint
and martyr.</p>

<p>The Norman settlers were not the only new element in
the population of the English towns. Flanders, the border-land
of Normandy, France and the Empire, the immediate
neighbour of the Norman dukes, the ally of the English
kings, had been for ages associated with the destinies of
England. The relation between the two countries was
primarily a political one; but kindred blood, kindred speech
and kindred temper drew Fleming and Englishman together
in the bonds of a natural sympathy which grew with the
growth of both nations. The merchants of Bruges were
even more familiar visitors in London than those of Rouen
and Caen. The trade with Flanders was the most important
part of the trade of eastern England. Not only was
the estuary of the Scheld a high-way of communication with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
the more distant regions of central Europe, but Flanders
herself was the head-quarters of a flourishing industry for
which the raw material was in great part furnished by England.
The cloth which all Europe flocked to buy at the
great yearly fairs of Bruges and Ghent was made chiefly
from the wool of English sheep. Dover was the chief mart
for this export; in the itinerary of the canons of Laon
we see Flemish merchants dispersing to buy wool all over
the country and bringing it up to Dover in great bales,
which were deposited in a warehouse built for that special
purpose till they could be shipped over sea.<a id="Anchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 154.">[154]</a> As yet the
Flemings had almost a monopoly of this weaving trade,
although the appearance of weavers’ gilds at Huntingdon,
Lincoln, Oxford and London may show that Englishmen
were already beginning to emulate their example; it may,
on the other hand, point to a Flemish element in the
population of these towns. In the time of William the
Conqueror some fellow-countrymen of his Flemish queen
had come not merely to traffic but to dwell in England; in
the time of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> they seem to have become numerous
and prosperous enough to excite the jealousy of both Normans
and English. It may have been partly to allay this
jealousy, but it was surely, nevertheless, a marked testimony
to their character as active and trustworthy members of the
state, that in 1111 Henry, casting about for a means of
holding in check the turbulent Welsh whose restlessness was
the one remaining element of disturbance in his realm,
planted a colony of these Flemings in the extremity of
South Wales, the southern part of our Pembrokeshire.<a id="Anchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 155.">[155]</a> The
experiment was a daring one; cut off as they were from all
direct communication with England, there must have seemed
little chance that these colonists could hold their own
against the Welsh. The success of the experiment is
matter not of history but of present fact; South Pembrokeshire
remains to this day a Teutonic land, a “little
England beyond Wales.” But the true significance of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Flemish settlements under Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> is for England rather
than for Wales. They are the first links of a social and
industrial, as distinguished from a merely political, connexion
between England and the Low Countries, which in later
days was to exercise an important influence on the life of
both peoples. They are the forerunners of two greater
settlements—one under Edward <abbr title="3">III.</abbr> and one under Elizabeth—which
were to work a revolution in English industry.</p>

<p>A third class of foreign settlers stood in a totally different
position from both the Fleming and the Norman.
These were the Jews. Their first appearance in England
is said to have been due to the Conqueror, who brought
over a Jewish colony from Rouen to London.<a id="Anchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 156.">[156]</a> They were
special favourites of William Rufus; under Henry they
play a less conspicuous part; but in the next reign we find
them at Lincoln, Oxford, and elsewhere, and there can be
no doubt that they were already established in most of the
chief English towns. They formed, however, no part of the
townsfolk. The Jew was not a member of the state; he
was the king’s chattel, not to be meddled with, for good or
for evil, save at the king’s own bidding. Exempt from toll
and tax and from the fines of justice, he had the means of
accumulating a hoard of wealth which might indeed be
seized at any moment by an arbitrary act of the king, but
which the king’s protection guarded with jealous care against
all other interference. The capacity in which the Jew
usually appears is that of a money-lender—an occupation in
which the scruples of the Church forbade Christians to engage,
lest they should be contaminated with the sin of usury.
Fettered by no such scruples, the Hebrew money-lenders
drove a thriving trade; and their loans doubtless contributed
to the material benefit of the country, by furnishing means
for a greater extension of commercial enterprize than would
have been possible without such aid. But, except in this
indirect way, their presence contributed nothing to the
political developement of the towns; and in their social
developement the Jewry, a distinct quarter exempt from the
jurisdiction of merchant-gild or port-reeve as well as from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
that of sheriff or bishop, shut off by impassable barriers from
the Christian community around it, had no part at all.</p>

<p>Outside this little separate world of the Jewry the
general manner of life was much the same in all ranks of
society. The domestic arrangements of the castle or manor-house
differed little from those of the citizen’s dwelling. In
both the accommodation usually consisted merely of a hall,
a “solar” or upper chamber raised on a substructure of
cellars, and a kitchen with its appendant offices.<a id="Anchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 157.">[157]</a> The hall
was the general living, eating, and sleeping-apartment for
the whole household. Its floor was of wood, strewn with
hay or rushes;<a id="Anchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 158.">[158]</a> a fire blazed upon a great stone hearth in
its centre, or in a wide recess at one end; and round the
fire were ranged in due order the tables and benches at
which the family, guests and servants all assembled for
meals. In the higher ranks of society the king’s friend
Count Robert of Meulan had set a fashion of taking but
one daily repast—the mid-day dinner—and those who

a burgher-mother rocked her baby to sleep, wrapped in a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
dainty silken coverlet.<a id="Anchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 165.">[165]</a> The whole house, whether in town
or country, was commonly of wood.<a id="Anchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 166.">[166]</a> With open hearths
and chimneys ill-constructed, or more probably altogether
lacking, the natural consequence was that fires in towns
were of constant occurrence and disastrous extent; Gilbert
Becket’s house was burnt over his head several times, and
in each case a large part of London shared in the destruction.<a id="Anchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 167.">[167]</a>
But the buildings thus easily destroyed were as
easily replaced; while the cost of a stone house was beyond
the means of any but the great nobles, unless it were here
and there some exceptionally wealthy Jew; and there was
no other building material to be had except wood or rubble,
for the nearest approach to a brick which had yet come into
general use was a tile;<a id="Anchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 168.">[168]</a> and although these were sometimes
used for roofing, the majority of houses, even in great cities
like London, were covered with thatch.<a id="Anchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 169.">[169]</a> All the architectural
energy of the time spent itself in two channels—military
and ecclesiastical; and even the castle was as yet a
very simple edifice. The various buildings which occupied
its outer ward were mere huts of wood or rubble; and the
stone wall of the keep itself, though of enormous thickness
and solidity, was often nothing more than a shell, the space
inside it being divided by wooden partitions into rooms
covered with lean-to roofs of thatch. Even where the keep
was entirely of stone, all thought of accommodation or elegance
was completely subordinated to the one simple, all-important
purpose of defence. It is this stern simplicity
which gives to the remains of our early castles a grandeur of
their own, and strikes the imagination far more impressively
than the elaborate fortifications of later times. But it left
no scope to the finer fancies of the architect. His feeling
for artistic decoration, his love of beauty, of harmonious
light and shade, had free play only in his work for the
Church; while the more general taste for personal luxury
and elegance had to find expression chiefly in minor matters,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
and especially in dress. During the last reign the extravagance
of attire among the nobles had been carried to a
pitch which called forth the energetic remonstrances of serious
men; prelate after prelate thundered against the unseemly
fashions—the long hair curled and scented like a
woman’s, the feminine ornaments, the long pointed shoes
and loose flowing garments which rendered all manly exercises
impossible.<a id="Anchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 170.">[170]</a> After the Red King’s death a reforming
party, headed by the new sovereign and his friend Robert
of Meulan,<a id="Anchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 171.">[171]</a> succeeded in effecting a return to the more
rational attire of the ordinary Norman knighthood; a close-fitting
tunic with a long cloak, reaching almost to the feet,
thrown over it for riding or walking.<a id="Anchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 172.">[172]</a> The English townsfolk,
then as now, endeavoured to copy the dress of their
neighbours from beyond the Channel. Among the rural
population, however, foreign fashions were slow to penetrate;
and the English countryman went on tilling his fields
clad in the linen smock-frock which had once been the
ordinary costume of all classes of men among his forefathers,
and which has scarcely yet gone out of use among his
descendants.</p>

<p>The life of the English country folk had changed since
the first days of the Norman settlement almost as little as
their dress. The final transformation, now everywhere complete,
of the ancient township into the feudal manor was
but the last step in a process which had begun at least as
far back as the time of Eadgar. The castle or manor-house
of the baron or lord, into which the thegn’s hall had now
developed, was the centre of rural life. Around it lay the
home-farm, the lord’s demesne land, cultivated partly by
free tenants, partly by the customary labour due from the
villeins whose cottages clustered on its border, and whose
holdings, with a tract of common pasture and common
woodland, made up the remainder of the estate. In the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
portion thus held in villenage, the arable land was distributed
in large open fields in strips of an acre or half an
acre in extent, each man holding a certain number of strips
scattered one in one field and one in another; while in proportion
to the total amount of land which he thus held he
contributed one ox or more to the team that drew the heavy
plough wherewith each whole field was ploughed in common.
On the estates of the great abbey of Peterborough the holdings
were mostly of virgates or half-virgates—that is, land
to the extent of some thirty or fifteen acres, and furnishing
in the former case two oxen, in the latter one ox, to the
common plough team, which usually consisted of four; those
belonging to the demesne were usually of six or eight.
Each tenant had, besides his land, a right to his share of
the common pasture and the common hay-meadow, as well
as of the common woodland where he fed his pigs on the
oak-mast, and cut turf and brushwood for fuel and other
household uses. Some of the lesser tenants had no land,
but were merely “cottiers,” occupying their little cottage
with or without a garden. Whatever the extent and
character of their holding, they held it in consideration of
certain services due to the lord, discharged partly by labour
upon his demesne land, partly by customary payments in
money or in kind, partly in work for specified purposes on
particular occasions, known as “boon” or “bene-work.”<a id="Anchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 173.">[173]</a>
The superintendence of all these matters was in the hands
of the reeve or bailiff of the manor, who was charged with
the regulation of its labour, the maintenance of its farming-stock,
the ingathering of its dues, the letting of its unoccupied
land, and the general account of its revenues.
Under his orders every villein was bound to do a certain
amount of “week-work”—to plough, sow, or reap, or otherwise
labour on the demesne land a certain number of days
every week; generally the obligation, on every virgate held in
villenage, was for two or three days a week throughout the
year, sometimes with an extra day at harvest-tide. The
customary dues and services varied with the special custom
of each manor; they consisted partly of payments either in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
kind or money, or both, and partly of services such as
hewing, carting, and drying wood, cutting turf, making
thatch, making malt, mowing and carrying hay, putting up
fences, providing ploughs and labour for a specified length
of time at particular seasons, ploughing, sowing, harrowing
and reaping a given extent of the demesne land. Some of
the rents were paid by the discharge of a special duty; the
cowherds, oxherds, shepherds, swineherds, usually held a
piece of land “by their service,” that is, in consideration
of their charge over the flocks and herds of the lord; sometimes
we find a further labour-rent paid by their wives, who
winnow and reap so much corn on the demesne.<a id="Anchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 174.">[174]</a> Many
of the cotters doubtless held their little dwellings on a
similar tenure, by virtue of their offices as the indispensable
craftsmen of the village community, such as the blacksmith,
the carpenter, or the wheelwright. The mill, too, an
important institution on every large manor, paid a fixed
money rent, and sometimes a tribute of fish from the mill-stream.<a id="Anchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 175.">[175]</a></p>

<p>We may draw some illustrations of the life of these
rural communities from the “Black Book” of Peterborough,
in which the manors belonging to the abbey were described
about the year 1125. On the manor of Thorp there were
twelve “full villeins” holding eleven acres each, and working
on the demesne three days a week; there were also six half
villeins who did the like in proportion to their holdings.
All these paid of custom ten shillings annually, besides five
sheep for eating, ten ells of linen cloth, ten porringers, and
two hundred loaves for the love-feast of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Peter; moreover
they all ploughed sixteen acres and a half for their lord.
Six <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bordarii</i> paid seven shillings a year; and they all
rendered twenty-two bushels of oats for their share of the
dead wood, twenty-two loaves, sixty-four hens, and one
hundred and sixty eggs.<a id="Anchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 176.">[176]</a> At Colingham twenty villeins
worked each one day a week, and three boon-days in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59">59</a></span>
August; they brought sixty waggon-loads of wood to the
manor-house, dug and carried twenty loads of turf and
twenty of thatch, harrowed all the winter-ploughing, and
paid annually four pounds in money. There were also
fifty sokemen who paid twelve pounds a year, ploughed,
harrowed and reaped eighteen acres, besides ploughing with
their own ploughs three times in Lent; each of them worked
three days in August, and served of custom six times a year
in driving the deer for the abbot’s hunting.<a id="Anchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 177.">[177]</a> At Easton
twenty-one villeins holding a virgate each worked twice a
week throughout the year and three boon-days in August;
they had twelve ploughs with which they worked once in
winter and once in spring, and then harrowed; they
ploughed fifteen acres and three roods, whereof five acres and
one rood were to be sown with their own seed; in spring
they had to plough ten acres and a half and sow twenty and
a half with their own seed; in summer, for fifteen days, they
had to do whatsoever the lord commanded. They also
made seventy-three bushels of malt from the lord’s barley;
and they paid seventeen shillings and sixpence a year. A
man named Toli held one virgate at a rent of five shillings
a year; and eleven sokemen held thirteen virgates and a
half by a payment of twelve shillings, two days’ work in
summer and winter, and fifteen days in summer at the lord’s
bidding. The miller, with a holding of six acres of arable
land and two of meadow, rendered one mark of silver to
the lord.<a id="Anchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 178.">[178]</a></p>

<p>Fisherton, again, supplies illustrations of a great variety of
services. On this manor there were twenty-six “full villeins,”
twelve “half villeins,” one “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">cotsetus</span>” and three “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">bordarii</span>.” The
full villeins worked two days a week, the half villeins one day,
throughout the year; the four cottagers worked one day a
week in August, their food being supplied by the lord. The
villeins had among them nine ploughs, which were all
brought into requisition once in winter and three times in
spring. The full villeins carted a load of wood, the half
villeins in proportion; the full villeins moreover ploughed
and harrowed of custom an acre in spring, and half an acre<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60">60</a></span>
in winter; they also lent their ploughs once in summer for
fallowing. At Pentecost the lord received one penny for
every villein plough-ox. Each full villein paid twopence at
Martinmas and thirty-two pence on the four quarter-days;
the half villeins paid half the sum. Every one of them gave
a hen at Christmas. The mill brought three shillings a
year, the fishing five shillings. Land enough for twelve full
villeins lay unoccupied; the reeve had to discharge its dues
out of his own purse, and hire it out at the best rent he
could get. There were twenty sokemen, holding three
ploughlands, and lending their ploughs once in winter, twice
in spring, and once for fallowing; each of them reaped one
acre, and did two days bene-work in August; at hay-harvest
they gave of custom three days’ work, one for
mowing, one for turning the hay, and one for carrying it;
each gave a hen at Christmas, and they all paid four pounds
a quarter. On the demesne were three ploughs, each with
a team of eight oxen; these were under the care of five
ox-herds, who held five acres each, and whose wives reaped
one day a week in August, the lord supplying their food.<a id="Anchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 179.">[179]</a>
At Oundle we get a glimpse not only of the rural township,
but of the little dependent town growing up on it. “In
Oundle are four hides paying geld to the king. Of these
hides, twenty-five men hold twenty virgates, and pay of
custom twenty shillings a year, forty hens, and two hundred
eggs. The men of the township have nine ploughs; from
Michaelmas to Martinmas they find ploughs for the lord’s
use once a week, and from Martinmas to Easter once a
fortnight, and ten acres fallow. Each virgate owes three
days’ work a week. There are ten <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bordarii</i>, who work one
day a week; and fifteen burghers, who pay thirty shillings.
The market of the township renders four pounds and three
shillings. A mill with one virgate renders forty shillings
and two hundred eels. The abbot holds the wood in his own
hand. The men of the township, with six herdsmen, pay
five shillings a year poll-tax. The church of this township
belongs to the altar of the abbey of Borough.”<a id="Anchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 180.">[180]</a></p>

<p>Services such as these were doubtless an irksome and a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61">61</a></span>
heavy burthen; to modern ideas of independence, the life of
the rural population was the degraded life of serfdom. But
there was another side to the system. The lord had his
duties as well as the villein; the villein had his rights as
well as the lord. When their work for the lord was done
and their customary dues were paid, the villagers were free
to make their own arrangements one with another for the
yoking of their oxen to the common ploughs and the tillage
of the common fields; and the rest of their time and produce
of their labour was theirs to do with as they would,
subject merely to such restrictions as to grinding at the
lord’s mill, or obtaining his license for the sale of cattle, as
were necessary for maintaining the integrity of the estate.
While they owed suit and service to their lord, he was bound
by his own interest as well as by law and duty to guard
them against external interference, oppression, or injury;
the extent of his rights over them, no less than of their
duties to him, was defined by a strict and minute code
of custom to which long prescription gave all and more than
all the force of law, and law itself could occasionally step in
to avenge the wronged villein even upon his lord; Alfred of
Cheaffword is recorded in the Pipe Roll as having paid
a fine of forty shillings for scourging a rustic of his own.<a id="Anchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 181.">[181]</a>
The villein’s life was not harder than that of the poor free
man; it was quite as secure from wrong, and far more
secure from want. The majority of the cultivators were
indeed tied to their land; but their land was equally tied to
them; the lord was bound to furnish each little bundle
of acre-strips with its proper outfit of plough-oxen, to provide
each tenant with his little cottage, and to see that the
heritage passed on to the next generation, just as the manor
itself, and with it the tenants and their services, passed from
father to son in the case of a lay proprietor, or from one
generation of monks to another in a case like that of
Peterborough. Even if a villein failed in his dues, the worst
punishment that could befall him was the seizure of his
little household goods; eviction was out of the question.
The serfdom of the villein was after all only the lowest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
link in a chain of feudal interdependence which ended only
with the king himself. If the “rustics” possessed their
homesteads only on condition of work done at the lord’s
bidding and for his benefit, the knight held his “fee” and
the baron his “honour” only on condition of a service to
the king, less laborious indeed, but more dangerous, and in
reality not a whit more morally elevating. If they had to
ask their lord’s leave for giving a daughter in marriage, the
first baron of the realm had to ask a like permission of the
king, and to pay for it too. If their persons and their
services could be transferred by the lord to another owner
together with the soil which they tilled, the same principle
really applied to every grade of feudal society; Count
William of Evreux only stated a simple fact in grotesque
language when he complained that his homage and his
services had been made over together with the overlordship
of his county by Robert Curthose to Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, with no more
regard to his own will than if he had been a horse or an
ox.<a id="Anchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 182.">[182]</a> The mere gift of personal freedom, when it meant the
uprooting of all local and social ties and the withdrawal
of all accustomed means of sustenance, would have been
in itself but a doubtful boon. There were, however, at
least three ways in which freedom might be attained.
Sometimes the lord on his death-bed, or in penance for
some great sin, would be moved by the Church’s influence
to enfranchise some of his serfs. Sometimes a rustic might
flee to one of the chartered towns, and if for the space of
a year and a day he could find shelter under its protecting
customs from the pursuit of his lord’s justice, he was thenceforth
a free burgher. And there was a greater city of
refuge whose protection was readier and surer still. The
Church had but to lay her consecrating hands upon a man,
and he was free at once. To ordain a villein or admit him
as a monk without his lord’s consent was indeed forbidden;
but the consecration once bestowed was valid nevertheless;
and the storm of indignation which met the endeavour of
Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> to enforce the prohibition shows that it had long
been almost a dead letter.</p>

<p>If the spiritual life of the English Church in the time of
Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> were to be judged solely from her highest official
representatives, it would certainly appear to have been at a
low ebb. <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Anselm had lived just long enough to accomplish
the settlement of the investitures, but not to direct its
working or experience its results. On his death early in
1109 Henry so far fell back into his brother’s evil ways as
to keep the metropolitan see vacant for five years. The
supreme direction of affairs in the Church as well as in the
state was thus left in the hands of the party represented by
Roger of Salisbury. Roger’s policy and that of his master
was indeed less flagrantly insulting to religion than that of
Rufus and Flambard; but it was hardly less injurious in a
moral and spiritual point of view. The most important sees
were no longer farmed by Jewish usurers for the king’s
benefit; the most sacred offices of the Church were no
longer openly sold to the highest bidder; but they were
made appendages to the great offices of the state; the
Church herself was practically turned into a mere handmaid
of the state, and her ministers into tools for the purposes of
secular government. The system had undoubted advantages
in a worldly point of view. A great deal of the most important
political and administrative work was of a nature
which, in the condition of society then existing, required the
services of a clerk rather than of a layman; moreover, a
man in holy orders, incapable of founding a family, and
standing, so to say, alone in the world, was less exposed to
the temptations and corruptions of place and power than a
layman surrounded with personal and social ties and open
to all sorts of personal and social ambitions, and could thus
be safely intrusted with a freedom of action and authority
such as in the hands of a lay baron with territorial and
family influence might have led to the most dangerous
results. On these and similar grounds Henry made a
practice of choosing his chief ministers from the ranks of
the clergy, and bestowing vacant bishoprics upon them,
by way either of rewarding their past labours or of insuring
a continuance of their zeal and devotion in the discharge of
their temporal functions. Thereby he undoubtedly secured to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
the state the services of a more able, vigorous and honest
set of administrators than could have been obtained by any
other means; but from another side the system lay open to
grave objection. The men whom it set over the dioceses
of England were, beyond all question, men of very superior
intelligence and energy, and, on the whole, of fair moral
character, men whom it would be most unjust to compare
for a moment with the hirelings who bought their sees of
William Rufus. But they were essentially of the world,
worldly; their minds and their hearts were both alike fixed
on their thoroughly well fulfilled duties as treasurer or
justiciar, not on their too often neglected duties as bishop
of Ely or Salisbury. And as were the bishops, so were the
priests. When once it became clear that the main road to
ecclesiastical preferment lay through the temporal service of
the crown, the whole body of secular clergy turned into a
nursery of statesmen, and while they rose to their highest
point of worldly importance the little spiritual influence
which they still retained passed altogether away. But the
Church’s life was not in her bishops and her priests; it
was in her humble, faithful laity. Down below the dull
utilitarianism, the “faithless coldness of the times,” the finer
sympathies and higher instincts of the soul lay buried but
not dead; ready to spring to the surface with a burst of
enthusiasm at the touch first of the Austin canons, and
then of the monks of Citeaux.</p>

<p>Of the two religious movements which at this time
stirred the depths of English society, the earlier, that of the
Austin canons, was in its origin not monastic but secular.
It arose, in fact, out of a protest against monasticism.
About the middle of the eleventh century an attempt had
been made to redress the balance between the regular and
secular clergy, and restore to the latter the influence and
consideration in spiritual matters which they had, partly by
their own fault, already to a great extent lost. Some
earnest and thoughtful spirits, distressed at once by the
abuse of monastic privileges and by the general decay of
ecclesiastical order, sought to effect a reform by the establishment
of a stricter and better organized discipline in those<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
cathedral and other churches which were served by colleges
of secular priests. For this end a rule composed in the
eighth century by Archbishop Chrodegang of Metz for the
members of his own chapter, and generally followed in the
collegiate churches of Gaul, was the model adopted by
cathedral reformers in England in the reigns of Eadward the
Confessor and William the Conqueror. Bishops Gisa of
Wells and Leofric of Exeter under the former king, Archbishop
Thomas of York under the latter, severally attempted
to enforce it upon their canons, but without success. The
English clergy were accustomed to the full enjoyment not
only of their separate property but of their separate houses;
many were even yet, in spite of Pope Gregory, married men
and fathers of families; and the new rule, which required
them to break up their homes and submit to community of
table and dwelling, was naturally resented as an attempt to
curtail their liberty and bring them under monastic restraint.
Lanfranc soon found that the only way to get rid of the old
lax system was to get rid of the canons altogether; accordingly,
from some few cathedrals the secular clerks were once
again, as in Eadgar’s days, driven out and replaced by
monks, this time to return no more till the great secularization
in the sixteenth century. But in the greater number of
churches the canons were influential enough to resist expulsion
as well as reform, and to maintain the old fashion with
its merits and its abuses, its good and evil sides, all alike
undisturbed and unrestrained. On the Continent, too, the
rule of Chrodegang proved unequal to the needs of the
time. Those who had the attainment of its object really at
heart ended by taking a lesson from their rivals and challenging
the monks with their own weapons. Towards the
beginning of the twelfth century the attempts at canonical
reform issued in the foundation of what was virtually a new
religious order, that of the Augustinians or Canons Regular
of the order of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Augustine. Like the monks and unlike
the secular canons, from whom they were carefully distinguished,
they had not only their table and dwelling but all
things in common, and were bound by a vow to the observance
of their rule, grounded upon a passage in one of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
letters of that great father of the Latin Church from whom
they took their name.<a id="Anchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 183.">[183]</a> Their scheme was a compromise
between the old-fashioned system of canons and that of the
monastic confraternities; but a compromise leaning strongly
towards the monastic side, tending more and more towards
it with every fresh developement, and distinguished from it
chiefly by a certain simplicity and elasticity of organization
which gave scope for an almost unlimited variety in the
adjustment of the relations between the active and the contemplative
life of the members of the order, thus enabling it
to adapt itself to the most dissimilar temperaments and to
the most diverse spheres of religious activity.</p>

<p>The Austin canons, as they were commonly called,
made their way across the Channel at the beginning of
Henry’s reign. The circumstances of their earliest settlement
illustrate the intimate connexion between the religious
and the national revival in England. Their first priory was
founded in 1108 by the English queen Matilda—“Maude
the good queen,” as they gratefully called her—in the soke
of Aldgate, just within the eastern wall of London. Part of
its endowment was furnished by the estates of an old English
cnihtengild whose members surrendered their property for
the benefit of the new community. The house was dedicated
to the Holy Trinity; its first prior, Norman by name,
was a native of Kent who had studied in Gaul under <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Anselm; through Anselm he was enabled to bring the
Augustinian order under the notice of Matilda, whose confessor
he afterwards became. How he lavished all his funds
on the furnishing of his church and the stocking of his
library; how the starving brotherhood set out a row of
empty plates in the refectory to attract the sympathy of the
citizens who were taking their Sunday stroll round the
suburb and peeping curiously in at the windows of the new
building; how the pitying burgher-wives vowed each to
bring a loaf every Sunday; and how the plates in the refectory<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
were never empty again<a id="Anchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 184.">[184]</a>—is a story which need not be
repeated in detail. Some fifteen years later Rahere the
king’s minstrel threw up his post at court to become the
head of an Austin priory which he built on a plot of waste
marshy ground along the eastern border of Smithfield. He
dedicated his establishment to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bartholomew and attached
to it an hospital for the relief of the sick and needy. Every
day—so tradition told—Alfhun, the master of the hospital,
went about the city as the Little Sisters of the Poor do to
this day, begging in the shops and markets for help towards
the support of the sick folk under his care. Most likely he
was himself a London citizen; his name is enough to prove
him of genuine English birth.<a id="Anchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 185.">[185]</a> Another famous Augustinian
house was that of Merton in Surrey. There the brotherhood
devoted themselves to educational work. Their most illustrious
scholar—born in the very year in which their house
was founded, 1117—is known to us already as Thomas the
son of Gilbert Becket. At the other end of England,
Walter Lespec, the noblest character among the lay barons
of the time, found comfort for the loss of an only son in
“making Christ his heir”—devoting to God’s service the
heritage which had been destined for his boy, and founding
the priory of Kirkham in Yorkshire on the spot where the
lad had expired.<a id="Anchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 186.">[186]</a> Before the close of Henry’s reign the
Austin canons had acquired such importance that two of
their order were raised to the episcopate, one even to the
primacy of all Britain. After five years of vacancy the
metropolitan chair of Canterbury was still too vividly haunted
by memories of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Anselm for Henry and Roger to venture
on trying to fill it from the ranks of the latter’s party; they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
gave it to Anselm’s old friend and suffragan, Ralf, bishop of
Rochester.<a id="Anchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 187.">[187]</a> But when Ralf, who at the time of his election
was already an aged man, died in 1122, the seculars, headed
by Roger of Salisbury, made a successful effort to secure a
non-monastic primate. Not daring, however, to go the full
length of appointing one of themselves, they took a middle
course and chose a canon regular, William of Corbeil, prior
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Osyth’s at Chiche in Essex.<a id="Anchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 188.">[188]</a> The strict monastic
party counted the new sort of canons very little better than
the old ones. William himself, however, was a perfectly
blameless churchman, whose worst fault was a constitutional
timidity and shrinking from political responsibilities which
made him powerless to stem the tide of worldliness among
his suffragans, though he at least kept the metropolitan chair
itself safe from contaminating influences. The case of the
other Augustinian prelate is a specially interesting one.
Henry, who so irritated both his English and Norman subjects
by his general preference for foreign churchmen, had
nevertheless chosen for his own spiritual adviser a priest
whose name, Eadwulf, shows him to have been of English
origin, and who was prior of an Augustinian house at
Nostell in Yorkshire. The king’s last act before he left
England in 1133, never to return, was to promote his confessor
to a bishopric. Twenty-three years before, following
out a cherished plan of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Anselm’s, he had caused the overworked
bishop of Lincoln to be relieved of part of his enormous
diocese by the establishment of a new see with the
great abbey of Ely for its cathedral and the monks for its
chapter.<a id="Anchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 189.">[189]</a> He now lightened the cares of the archbishop of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
York in like manner by giving him a new suffragan whose
see was fixed at Carlisle. Eadwulf was appointed bishop;
naturally enough he constituted his chapter on the principles
of his own order; and Carlisle, the last English bishopric
founded before the Reformation, was also the only one whose
cathedral church was served by canons regular of the order
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Augustine.<a id="Anchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 190.">[190]</a></p>

The king wanted to appoint Faricius, abbot of Abingdon;
his choice was opposed by the seculars, who wanted one of their own party. This
the monks of Christ Church resisted, but, as Faricius was obnoxious because he
was an Italian, they finally all agreed upon Ralf, and the king confirmed their
choice.

<p>Meanwhile a mightier influence than theirs was regenerating
all the Churches of the West—our own among the
number. Its root was in a Burgundian wilderness; but the
seed from which it sprang was of English birth. Harding
was an Englishman who spent his boyhood in the monastery
of Sherborne in Dorset, till he was seized with a passion for
wandering and for study which led him first to Scotland,
then to Gaul, and at last to Rome. It chanced that on his
return thence, passing through the duchy of Burgundy, he
stopped at the abbey of Molêmes. As he saw the ways
and habits familiar to his childhood reproduced in those of
the monks, the wanderer’s heart yearned for the peaceful
life which he had forsaken; he took the vows, and became
a brother of the house. But when, with the zeal of a convert,
he began to look more closely into his monastic obligations,
he perceived that the practice of Molêmes, and indeed
of most other monasteries, fell very far short of the strict
rule of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Benedict. He remonstrated with his brethren till
they had no rest in their minds. At last, after long and
anxious debates in the chapter, the abbot determined to go
to the root of the matter, and appointed two brethren, whose
learning was equalled by their piety, to examine diligently
the original rule and declare what they found in it. The
result of their investigations justified Harding’s reproaches
and caused a schism in the convent. The majority refused
to alter their accustomed ways; finding they were not to
be reformed, the zealous minority, consisting of Robert the
abbot, Harding himself (or Stephen, as he was called in
religion), and sixteen others equally “stiff-necked in their
holy obstinacy,” left Molêmes, and sought a new abode in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
the wilderness. The site which they chose—in the diocese
of Chalon-sur-Saône, not far from Dijon—was no happy
valley, no “green retreat” such as the earlier Benedictine
founders had been wont to select. It was a dismal swamp
overgrown with brushwood, a forlorn, dreary, unhealthy spot,
from whose marshy character the new house took its name
of “the Cistern”—<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cistellum</i>, commonly called Citeaux.
There the little band set to work in 1098 to carry into
practice their views of monastic duty. The brotherhood of
Molêmes, left without a head by their abbot’s desertion, presently
appealed to the archbishop of Lyons and the Pope,
and after some negotiation Robert, willingly or unwillingly,
returned to his former post. His departure gave a shock to
the foundations of the new community; zeal was already
growing cold, and of those who had followed him out from
Molêmes all save eight followed him back again. Those
eight—“few in number, but a host in merit”—at once chose
their prior Alberic to be abbot in Robert’s stead, while the
true founder, Stephen Harding, undertook the duties of
prior. Upon Alberic’s death in 1110 Stephen became
abbot in his turn, and under him the little cistern in the
wilderness became a fountain whose waters flowed out far
and wide through the land. Three-and-twenty daughter-houses
were brought to completion during his life-time.
One of the earliest was Pontigny, founded in 1114, and
destined in after-days to become inseparably associated with
the name of another English saint. Next year there went
forth another Cistercian colony, whose glory was soon to
eclipse that of the mother-house itself. Its leader was a
young monk called Bernard, and the place of its settlement
was named Clairvaux.<a id="Anchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 191.">[191]</a></p>

<p>From Burgundy and Champagne the “White Monks,”
as the Cistercians were called from the colour of their habit,
soon spread over France and Normandy. In 1128 they
crossed the sea and made an entrance into their founder’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
native land; William Giffard, bishop of Winchester, founded
the abbey of Waverley in Surrey for twelve monks from the
Cistercian house of Aumône in Normandy.<a id="Anchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 192.">[192]</a> The movement
spread rapidly in all directions. In 1131 Walter Lespec
the founder of Kirkham, zealous in every good work, established
in the heart of the Yorkshire wolds a “daughter of
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard,” the abbey of Rievaux;<a id="Anchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 193.">[193]</a> far away on the Welsh
border, in the valley of the Wye, Tintern was founded in
the same year by Walter de Clare.<a id="Anchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 194.">[194]</a> The story of another
famous Yorkshire house, Fountains, is a curious repetition
of that of Citeaux itself. Thirteen monks of the Benedictine
convent of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mary at York, fired by the example of
the newly-established brotherhood at Rievaux, determined,
like Stephen Harding and his friends at Molêmes, to go
forth into the wilderness where they might follow the Cistercian
rule in freedom. But when they asked their abbot’s
leave to depart it was sternly refused. Archbishop Thurstan,
to whom they appealed for support, came in person to plead
their cause with the abbot, and was so insolently received
that after a stormy scene in the chapter-house he laid the
convent under interdict, and walked out followed by the
zealous thirteen “with nothing but the clothes on their
backs.” The warmly-sympathizing primate gave them a
temporary shelter in his own home; at Christmas he
bestowed upon them for their dwelling a lonely valley called
Skeldale, near Ripon, “full of thorns and enclosed by rocks,”
and for their maintenance the little township of Sutton.
They at once chose one of their number, Richard by name,
as abbot, and went forth under his guidance to settle in
their new abode, although the cold of a Yorkshire winter
was at its bitterest, and they had not where to lay their
heads. In the middle of the valley stood a great elm—“thick
and leafy as elms are wont to be.”<a id="Anchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 195.">[195]</a> That tree was
the original abbey of our Lady of Fountains. Its spreading
branches formed a roof to shelter the little band of monks;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
“their bread was supplied to them by the archbishop, their
drink by the streamlet which ran through the valley,” and
which, as in the case of Citeaux, suggested a name for the
future house. In this primitive dwelling they fulfilled their
religious exercises in peace and contentment till the winter
was past, when they began to think of constructing a more
substantial abode. They had no mind to follow their own
inspirations and set up an independent rule of their own;
in all humility they wrote to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard (who since the
death of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Stephen Harding was universally looked up to
as the head of the Cistercian order), telling him all their
story, and beseeching him to receive them as his children.
Bernard answered by sending to them, with a letter full of
joyous welcome and hearty sympathy, his friend and confidant,
Godfrey, to instruct them in the Cistercian rule.
They had now been joined by ten more brethren. But the
elm-tree was still their only shelter, and their means of subsistence
were as slender as at the first. Presently there
came a famine in the land; they were reduced to eke out
their scanty store of bread with leaves and stewed herbs.
When they had just given away their two last loaves—one
to the workmen engaged on the building, the other to a
passing pilgrim—this supreme act of charity and faith was
rewarded with a supply sent them by the lord of Knaresborough,
Eustace Fitz-John. At last, after struggling on
bravely for two years, they found it impossible to continue
where they were, with numbers constantly increasing and
means at a standstill; so the abbot went to Clairvaux and
begged that some place might be assigned to them there.
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard granted the request; but when Abbot Richard
came back to fetch the rest of the brotherhood he found that
all was changed. Hugh, dean of York, had just made over
himself and all his property to Fountains. It was the turn
of the tide; other donations began to flow in; soon they
poured. Five years after its own rise the “Fountain” sent
out a rivulet to Newminster; after that her descendants
speedily covered the land. Justly did the brotherhood
cherish their beloved elm-tree as a witness to the lowly
beginnings whence had sprung the mightiest Cistercian<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
house in England. It bore a yet more touching witness
four centuries later, when it still stood in its green old age,
the one remnant of the glory of Fountains which the sacrilegious
spoiler had not thought it worth his while to touch.<a id="Anchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 196.">[196]</a></p>

<p>The influence of the Cistercians was different in kind from
that of the earlier monasticism. The life of the Benedictines
was, so to say, in the world though not of it. They sought
tranquillity and retirement, but not solitude; the site of an
abbey was chosen with a careful eye to the natural resources
of the place, its accessibility, and the advantages which it
offered for cultivation and production of all kinds. A
Benedictine house almost invariably became, and indeed
was intended to become, the nucleus of a flourishing lay
population, either a cluster of rural settlements, or, not
unfrequently, a busy, thriving town. But by the close of
the tenth century, although the palmy days of the Benedictine
fathers as the guardians of art and literature were in
part still to come, the work in which they had been unrivalled
for five hundred years, as the missionaries, cultivators
and civilizers of Europe, was well-nigh accomplished;
and the position into which they had unavoidably drifted
as owners of vast landed property protected by special
privileges was beginning to show its dangerous side. On
the one hand, the secularizing spirit which had made such inroads
upon the Church in general was creeping even into the
cloister. On the other, the monasteries were growing rich
and powerful at the expense of the parochial and diocesan
organization. The laity were too apt, while showering their
pious gifts upon the altars of the religious houses, to leave
those of their own parish churches naked and uncared-for;
and the growing habit of diverting the tithes of various
estates and districts to the endowment of some abbey with
which they were quite unconnected was already becoming a
distinct abuse. Against all this the scheme of the Cistercians
was a direct protest. They refused to have anything<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
to do with tithes in any shape, saying that monks had no
right to them; their houses were of the plainest possible
construction: even in their churches scarcely an ornament
was admitted to soften the stern grandeur of the architecture;
there were no broidered hangings, no delicate paintings,
no gold and silver vessels, no crucifixes glittering with
enamel and precious gems; they hardly allowed, even for
the most solemn rite, the use of any vestment more ornate
than the simple white surplice or alb; and their ordinary
habit, made from the wool of their flocks, was not black like
that of the Benedictines, but the natural white or gray,
for they looked upon dyeing as a refinement useless to men
who had renounced the cares and pleasures of this life as
well as the deceitfulness of riches.<a id="Anchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 197.">[197]</a> Their aim was to be
simply voices crying in the wilderness—a wilderness wherein
they were resolved to dwell, as much as possible, alone.
Their rule absolutely forbade the erection of a house even
of their own order within a certain distance of another.
But the cry that came forth from the depth of their solitude
thrilled through the very hearts of men, and their influence
spread far beyond the number of those who actually joined
the order. It was the leaven of that influence, more than
all others, which worked on and on through the nineteen
years of anarchy that followed Henry’s death till it had
leavened the whole lump, regenerated the Church, and made
her ready to become in her turn the regenerator of the state
and the nation. Already, before the order of Citeaux had
been half a century in existence, William of Malmesbury,
himself a member of one of the most ancient and famous of
English Benedictine abbeys, could describe it as the unanimously
acknowledged type of the monastic profession, the
ideal which served as a mirror to the diligent, a goad to the
negligent, and a model to all.<a id="Anchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 198.">[198]</a></p>

<p>How deeply the spirit of religious enthusiasm had
penetrated among the people we see in the story of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Godric. Godric was born in the last years of the Conqueror
or the earliest years of the Red King at Walpole, a village in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
the north-western marshlands of Norfolk; thence his parents,
Ælward and Ædwen, seem to have removed to a place on
the river Welland, near Spalding in Lincolnshire. They
were apparently free rustics of the poorest class, simple, unlearned,
upright folk, who taught their three children to say
the Creed and the Lord’s Prayer, and brought them up in
the fear of God; other education they could give them
none, and of worldly goods just as little. In the dreary
fenland round the shores of the Wash agriculture and industry
were almost unknown, and the population subsisted
chiefly on whatever they found left behind by the waves
on the long reaches of shining sand that lay exposed whenever
the tide was out. As a boy Godric once wandered
thus nearly three miles out to sea in search of food for
himself and his parents; as he was retracing his steps, laden
with part of a large fish which he had at length found dead
upon the sand, he was overtaken by the returning tide;
press onward as he might, the waves came surging higher
and higher, first to his knees, then to his waist, then to his
shoulders, till to the boy’s excited fancy their gurgling rose
even above his head, and when at last he struggled to land
with his burthen, it seemed to him that only a miracle had
brought him through the waters in safety. Presently he
began an independent life as a wandering chapman, trudging
from village to village and selling small wares to country-folk
as poor as himself. The lad was gifted with a wisdom
and seriousness beyond his age; after some four years of
this life he became associated with some merchants in the
neighbouring towns; with them he visited the castles of the
local nobles, the markets and fairs of the local trading
centres, and at length made his way as far as <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Andrews
in Scotland, and after that to Rome. He next, entering
into partnership with some other young men, acquired a
fourth share in the profits of one trading-vessel and half the
ownership of another. Very soon his partners made him
captain of the ship. In the long, blank days of his boyhood
by the shore of the Wash he had learned to discern the face
of both sea and sky; and his sturdy frame, steady hand, and
keen observant eye, as well as his stedfast thoughtful temper,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76">76</a></span>
fitted him for a skilful seaman no less than for a successful
merchant. The young sailor’s heart, however, was not
wholly set upon money-getting. As he tramped over the
fens with his pack upon his back he had been wont to soothe
his weariness with the holy words of prayer and creed learnt
at his mother’s knee; as he guided his bark through the
storm, or outran the pirates who were ever on the look-out
for such prey, he did not miss the lesson specially addressed
to those who “go down to the sea in ships.” Wherever
his business took him—Scotland, Britanny, Flanders, Denmark—he
sought out the holy places of the land and made
his offerings there. One of the places he visited most
frequently was <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Andrews; and on his way back from
thence he rarely failed to turn aside to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Cuthbert’s old
home at Holy Isle and his yet more lonely retreat at Farne,
there to spend hours in ecstatic meditation upon the hermit-life
which he was already longing to imitate. At last he
took the cross and went on pilgrimage to Jerusalem. On
his return, weary of independence, he became steward to a
rich man who intrusted him with the whole management of
his household; soon, however, he grew so disgusted with the
thievery among the servants, which he saw but could not
prevent, and with the master’s indifference to it, that he
threw up his situation and went off on another pilgrimage,
first to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Gilles in Provence and then to Rome. He came
home to his parents, but he could not stay; he must go
back yet a third time, he told them, to the threshold of the
Apostles; and this time his mother accompanied him. At
a period when religious men of greater experience in this
world’s affairs were pouring out heart-rending lamentations
over the corruptions of Rome, it is touching to see that she
still cast over this simple English rustic the spell which she
had cast of old over Wilfrid and Benedict Biscop. It was
in the land of Wilfrid and Benedict, in the wild Northumbria,
with its long reaches of trackless moor and its mighty
forests, scarcely penetrated save by the wild beasts, that
Godric at last found refuge from the world. He sought
it first at Carlisle, then a lonely outpost on the western
borders of the moors, just beginning a new life after its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77">77</a></span>
conquest by William Rufus. His hopes of remaining there
in obscurity were, however, defeated by the recognition of a
kinsman, doubtless one of the Red King’s colonists, and he
fled yet further into the wilderness. Weeks and months of
lonely wandering through the forest brought him unexpectedly
to an aged hermit at Wolsingham; there he
remained nearly three years, tending the old man until his
death; then a vision of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Cuthbert sent Godric off again,
first on another journey to Holy Land, and then to a
hermitage in Eskdale near Whitby. Thence the persecution
of the lord of the soil drove him to a surer refuge in the
territory of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Cuthbert. He settled for a while in Durham
and there gave himself up to practical works of piety, frequenting
the offices of devotion, giving alms out of his
penury to those who were yet poorer than himself, and constantly
sitting as a scholar among the children in the church
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mary. His kinsman at Carlisle had given him a
Psalm-book; whether he ever learned actually to read it is
not clear; but he already knew by heart a considerable part
of the Psalter; at Durham he learned the whole; and the
little book, which he had carried in all his wanderings, was
to the end of his life his most cherished possession. When
asked in later years how one of his fingers had grown
crooked, he answered with a smile that it had become
cramped with constantly grasping this book. Meanwhile he
was seeking a place of retirement within easy distance of the
chief object of his devotion—<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Cuthbert’s shrine. His
choice was decided by the chance words of a shepherd to
his comrade: “Let us go water our flocks at Finchale!”
Godric offered the man his sole remaining coin—a farthing—to
lead him to the spot, and saw at once that he had
reached the end of his wanderings.</p>

<p>Even to-day the scene is wild and solemn enough, to the
traveller who, making his way from Durham over the lonely
country-side, suddenly dips down into a secluded hollow
where the ruins of Finchale Priory stand on a low grassy
ledge pressed close between the rushing stream of Wear and
the dark wooded hills which, owing to the sharp bend made
by the river, seem to close round it on every side. But in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78">78</a></span>
Godric’s day the place was wilder still. The road which now
leads through the wood was a mere sheep-track worn by the
feet of the flocks as they made their way down to the river;
the site of the priory was a thicket of briars, thorns and
nettles, and it was only on a narrow strip of rocky soil
hanging over the water’s edge and thinly covered with scant
herbage that the sheep could find a foothold and the hermit
a place for his dwelling. His first abode was a cave scooped
in the rock; later on he seems to have built himself a little
hut with an oratory attached. A large stone served him at
once for table and pillow; but only when utterly worn out
with a long day’s toil in clearing away the thickets and preparing
the soil for cultivation would he lie down for a few
hours of quiet vigil rather than of sleep; and on moonlight
nights the rustics of the country-side woke with a start at
the ring of the hermit’s axe, echoing for miles through the
woodland. The spirit of the earlier Northumbrian saints
seems to breathe again in Godric’s ceaseless labour, his stern
self-mortification, his rigid fasts, his nightly plunges into the
Wear, where he would stand in the hollow of the rocks, up
to his neck in the stream, singing Psalms all through the
winter nights, while the snow fell thick on his head or the
waters froze around him. With the fervour of the older
asceticism he had caught too its poetic tenderness. As he
wandered through forest after forest from Carlisle to the
Tees he had found like <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Guthlac of old that “he who
denies himself the converse of men wins the converse of
birds and beasts and the company of angels.” Noxious
reptiles lay passive beneath his feet as he walked along and
crawled harmlessly about him as he lay on the bare ground
at night; “the hissing of a viper scared him no more than
the crowing of a cock.” The woods of Finchale were
thronged with wild beasts of every kind; on his first arrival
he was confronted by a wolf of such enormous size that he
took it for a fiend in wolf’s shape, and the impression was
confirmed when at the sign of the Cross the animal lay down
for a moment at his feet and then slunk quietly away. The
toads and vipers which swarmed along the river-side played
harmlessly about the floor of his hut, and basked in the glow<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79">79</a></span>
of his fire or nestled between his feet, till finding that they
disturbed his devotions he gently bade them depart, and was
at once obeyed. A stag browsing upon the young shoots
of the trees in his little orchard suffered him to put a halter
about its neck and lead it away into the forest. In the long
hard frosts of the northern winter he would roam about
seeking for frozen or starving animals, carry them home
in his arms and restore them to warmth and animation
at his fire. Bird and beast sought shelter from
the huntsman in the hermit’s cell; one stag which he had
hidden from the followers of Bishop Ralf came back day
after day to be petted and caressed. Amid the silence of
the valley, broken only by the rustling of the wind through
the trees, the ripple of the stream over its rocky bed, and
the chirping of the birds who had probably given their name
to the “Finches-haugh,” strains of angel-harps and angel-voices
sounded in the hermit’s ears; and the Virgin-Mother
came down to teach him how to sing to her in his own
English tongue. As the years went on Godric ceased to
shrink from his fellow-men; his mother, his sister, came to
dwell near him in religious retirement; a little nephew was
admitted to tend his cow. Some of the younger monks of
Durham, among them the one to whom we owe the record of
Godric’s life, were the devoted attendants of his extreme age;
while from the most distant quarters men of all ranks flocked to
seek counsel and guidance in every variety of circumstances,
temporal and spiritual, from one whom not only all Durham
but almost all England looked upon as a saint and a prophet.<a id="Anchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 199.">[199]</a></p>

The story of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Godric is in

Durham (Surtees Society)</cite>.

</div>

<p>It was in 1122—two years after the wreck of the <i>White
Ship</i>—that Godric settled at Finchale, and he dwelt there
sixty years. He is the last of the old English saints; his
long life, beginning probably before the Conqueror’s death
and ending only seven years before that of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, is
a link between the religious life of the earlier England
which had passed away and that of the newer England
which was arising in its place. The spiritual side of the
revival was in truth closely connected with its national side.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
All the foreign influences which the Norman conquest had
brought to bear upon the English Church had failed to
stamp out her intensely national character; nay, rather, she
was already beginning to lead captive her conquerors. One
of the most striking signs of the times was the renewal of
reverence for those older English saints whose latest successor
was striving to bury himself in the woodlands of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Cuthbert’s
patrimony. Normans and English hushed their differences
before the grave of the Confessor; Lanfranc was forced to
acknowledge the sanctity of Ælfheah. At Canterbury itself
the memory not only of Lanfranc but even of Anselm was
still eclipsed by that of Dunstan. The very changes introduced
by Norman prelates or Norman patrons, their zeal
for discipline or their passion for architectural display, worked
in the same direction. It was in the old minster of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Werburg that Earl Hugh of Chester had placed the Benedictine
colony whose settlement helped to bring about the
appointment of Anselm as primate; it was in honour of
another early Mercian saint, Milburg, that Roger of Shrewsbury
reared his abbey at Wenlock. Bishop Richard of
London planted the Austin canons at Chiche over the shrine
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Osyth; Bishop Roger of Salisbury planted them at
Oxford over that of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Frideswide. The foundation of a
bishop’s see at Ely brought a fresh lustre to the glory of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Etheldreda; and the matchless church at Durham on which two
of the very worldliest and worst of Norman prelates, William
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Calais and Ralf Flambard, lavished all the splendour
that art could devise or wealth procure, was one vast monument
to the honour of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Cuthbert. Literary activity was
re-awakened by a like impulse. Two successive precentors
of Canterbury, Osbern and Eadmer, had already worked up
into more elaborate biographies the early memorials of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Dunstan. Eadmer’s best inspiration came to him indeed
from a nearer source; his most valuable work is the history
of his own time, which he grouped, as in a picture, around
the central figure of his own master, Anselm. It was
doubtless from that master that he had learnt a breadth of
sympathy which extended far beyond his local associations
at Canterbury. The saints of the rival archbishopric, Wilfrid<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
and Oswald, found in him a new biographer. In the
northern province, Simeon and his fellow-monks were busy
at Durham with the story of their own church and its patron,
Cuthbert. In the south, again, Faricius, the Italian abbot of
Abingdon, was writing a life of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Ealdhelm; while almost
every church of importance in central and southern England
was throwing open its archives to the eager researches, and
contributing its memorials of early Mercian and West-Saxon
saints to swell the hagiological collections of a young monk
at Ealdhelm’s own Malmesbury.</p>

<p>There was one cathedral monastery in the west of England
where the traditions of a larger historical sentiment had
never died out. The scriptorium at Worcester had been for
more than a century the depository of the sole contemporary
edition of the English Chronicle;<a id="Anchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 200.">[200]</a> and there alone the national
history continued to be recorded in the national tongue
down to the early years of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> In the middle of his
reign the monks of Peterborough, probably in consequence
of the loss of their own records in a fire which destroyed
their abbey in 1116, borrowed a copy of the Chronicle from
Worcester, and wrote it out afresh for their own use, with
additions from local history and other sources. It is only
in their version that the earliest Chronicle of Worcester has
been preserved to us. But they did more than transcribe
the story of the past. When the copyist had brought his
work down to the latest event of his own day—the sinking
of the <i>White Ship</i> in 1120—another scribe carried on the
annals of Peterborough and of England for ten more years,
in the native speech of the land; and when he laid down
his pen it was taken up by yet another English writer whose
notices of contemporary history, irregular and fragmentary
though they are, still cast a gleam of light across the darkness
of the “nineteen winters” which lie between the death
of the first King Henry and the coming of the second.<a id="Anchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 201.">[201]</a></p>

<p>Precious as it is to us, however, this English chronicle-work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
at Peterborough was a mere survival. Half its pathetic
interest indeed springs from the fact that it stands utterly
alone; save in that one abbey in the Fens, English had
ceased to be a written tongue; the vernacular literature of
England was dead. If the reviving national sentiment was
to find a literary expression which could exercise any lasting
and widespread influence, the vehicle must be not English
but Latin. This was the work now taken up by the historical
school of Worcester. Early in the twelfth century a
Worcester monk named Florence made a Latin version of
the Chronicle. Unhappily, he infused into his work a violent
party spirit, and overlaid the plain brief statements of the
annals with a mass of interpolations, additions and alterations,
whose source it is impossible to trace, and which, adopted
only too readily by later writers, have gone far to bring our
early history into what until a very recent time seemed well-nigh
hopeless confusion. But the very extent of his influence
proves how true was the instinct which led him—patriot of
the most narrow, insular, exaggerated type, as the whole
tone of his work shows him to have been—to clothe the
ancient vernacular annals in a Latin dress, in the hope of
increasing their popularity. If English history has in one
way suffered severely at his hands, it owes him a debt of
gratitude nevertheless upon another ground. While the last
English chronicle lay isolated and buried in the scriptorium
at Peterborough, it was through the Latin version of Florence
that the national and literary tradition of the school of
Worcester made its way throughout the length and breadth
of the land, and inspired a new generation of English
historians. Simeon of Durham, copying out and piecing
together the old Northumbrian annals which had gone on
growing ever since Bæda’s death, no sooner met with the
chronicle of Florence than he made it the foundation of his
own work for the whole space of time between Ælfred’s
birth in 848 and Florence’s own death in 1118; and from
Simeon it was handed down, through the work of another
local historian, to be incorporated in the great compilation
of Roger of Howden.<a id="Anchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 202.">[202]</a> Henry of Huntingdon, who soon after
1125,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span> at the instigation of Bishop Alexander of Lincoln, began
to collect materials for a history of the English, may have learnt
from the same source his method of dealing with the English
Chronicle, though he seems, naturally enough, to have chiefly
used the copy which lay nearest to his own hand at Peterborough.
Meanwhile, at the opposite end of England, a
finer and subtler intellect than that of either Florence or
Simeon or Henry had caught the historical impulse in an
old West-Saxon monastery.</p>

<p>William of Malmesbury was born some three or four
years before the Conqueror’s death,<a id="Anchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 203.">[203]</a> in or near the little
town in Wiltshire from which his surname was derived. One
of his parents seems to have been Norman, the other English.<a id="Anchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 204.">[204]</a>
They early destined their son to a literary career; “My
father,” he says, “impressed upon me that if I turned aside
to other pursuits, I should but waste my life and imperil
my good name. So, remembering the recommendation to
make a virtue of necessity, I persuaded myself, young as I
was, to acquire a willing taste for that to which I could not
in honour show myself disinclined.” It is plain that submission
to the father’s wishes cost no great effort to the boy.
As he tells us himself, “Reading was the pleasure whose
charms won me in my boyhood and grew with my growing
years.”<a id="Anchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 205.">[205]</a> His lot was cast in a pleasant place for one of
such a disposition. Fallen though it was from its ancient
greatness, some remnants of its earlier culture still hung
about Malmesbury abbey. The place owed its rise to an
Irish recluse, Maidulf, who, in the seventh century sought
retirement from the world in the forest which at that time
covered all the northern part of Wiltshire. Maidulf,
however, was a scholar as well as a saint; and in those
days, when Ireland was the light of the whole western
world, no forest, were it never so gloomy and impenetrable,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
could long hide an Irish scholar from the eagerness of the
disciples who flocked to profit by his teaching. The hermitage
grew into a school, and the school into a religious
community. Its second abbot, Ealdhelm, is one of the
most brilliant figures in the history of early West-Saxon
learning and culture. The architecture of Wessex owed its
birth to the churches which he reared along the edge of the
forest-tract of Dorset and Wiltshire, from the seat of his
later bishopric at Sherborne to his early home at Malmesbury;
its Latin literature was moulded by the learning
which he brought back from Archbishop Theodore’s school
at Canterbury; and the whole ballad literature of southern
England sprang from his English songs. The West-Saxon
kings, from Ine to Eadgar, showered their benefactions upon
the house of one whom they were proud to call their kinsman.
It escaped as by a miracle from the destruction of
the Danish wars; and in the Confessor’s reign its wealth
and fame were great enough to tempt the diocesan bishop,
Herman of Ramsbury, into a project for making it the seat
of his bishopric. Darker times began with the coming of
the first Norman abbot, Turold, whose stern and warlike
character, more befitting a soldier than a monk, soon induced
the king to transfer him to Peterborough, as a check upon
the English outlaws and their Danish allies in the camp
of refuge at Ely. His successor at Malmesbury, Warin,
alienated for his own profit the lands and the treasures
which earlier benefactors had lavished upon the abbey, and
showed his contempt for the old English abbots by turning
the bones of every one of them, except Ealdhelm, out of their
resting-places on either side the high altar, and thrusting
them into a corner of one of the lesser churches of the town,
with the mocking comment: “Whosoever is mightiest among
them may help the rest!” William’s boyhood, however, fell
in happier days. About the time of his birth Warin died,
and the next abbot, Godfrey, set himself to a vigorous work
of material, moral and intellectual reform which must have
been in full career when William entered the abbey-school.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span><a id="Anchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 206.">[206]</a>
The bent of the lad’s mind showed itself in the subjects
which he chose for special study out of the general course
taught in the school. “Logic, which serves to give point to
our discourse, I tasted only with my ears; to physic, which
cures the diseases of our bodies, I paid somewhat closer
heed. But I searched deeply into the various branches of
moral philosophy, whose dignity I hold in reverence, because
it is self-evident to those who study it, and disposes our
minds to virtuous living;—and especially into history, which,
preserving in a pleasing record the manners of times gone
by, by example excites its readers to follow that which is
good and shun that which is evil.”<a id="Anchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 207.">[207]</a> Young as he was, his
studious habits gained him the confidence of the abbot.
Godfrey’s darling scheme was the formation of a library;
and when at length he found time and means to attempt its
execution, it was William who became his most energetic
assistant. “Methinks I have a right to speak of this work,”
he tells us with pardonable pride, “for herein I came behind
none of my elders, nay, if it be not boastful to say so, I far
outstripped them all. I rivalled the good abbot’s own
diligence in collecting that pile of books; I did my utmost
to help in his praiseworthy undertaking. May those who
now enter into our labours duly cherish their fruits!”<a id="Anchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 208.">[208]</a></p>

<p>It is not difficult to guess in what department of the
library William took the deepest interest. Half Norman as
he was by descent, the chosen literary assistant of a Norman
abbot,<a id="Anchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 209.">[209]</a> it was natural that his first endeavour should be to
“collect, at his own expense, some histories of foreign
nations.” As he pondered over them in the quiet cloisters
of the old English monastery which by this time had
become his home, the question arose—could nothing be
found among our own people worthy of the remembrance
of posterity?<a id="Anchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 210.">[210]</a> He had but to look around him, and the
question answered itself. To the antiquary and the scholar
Malmesbury was already classic ground, where every step<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
brought him face to face with some memory of the glories
of Wessex under the old royal house from which Ealdhelm
sprang. To Ealdhelm’s own fame indeed even the prejudices
of Abbot Warin had been forced to yield, and a new translation
of the saint’s relics in 1078 had been followed by
a fresh outburst of popular devotion and a fresh influx
of pilgrims to his shrine. Every year his festival brought
together a crowd of devotees, of sick folk seeking the aid of
his miraculous powers, and—as generally happened in such
cases—of low jesters seeking only to make their profit out
of the amusement which they afforded to the gaping multitude.
The punishment of one of these, who was smitten
with frenzy and only cured after three days’ intercession on
the part of the monks, during which he lay chained before
the shrine, was one of the most vivid recollections of
William’s childhood.<a id="Anchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 211.">[211]</a> In the vestiary of the abbey-church
he beheld with wonder and awe the chasuble which, as
a quaint legend told, the saint in his pious abstraction
of mind had once hung upon a sunbeam, and whose unusual
length helped to furnish a mental picture of his tall stately
form.<a id="Anchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 212.">[212]</a> Among the older literary treasures which served as
a nucleus for the new library, he gazed with scarcely less
reverence on a Bible which Ealdhelm had bought of some
foreign merchants at Dover when he visited Kent for his
consecration.<a id="Anchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 213.">[213]</a> The muniment-chest was full of charters
granted by famous kings of old, Ceadwalla and Ine, Ælfred
and Eadward, Æthelstan and Eadgar. In the church itself
a golden crucifix, a fragment of the wood of the Cross, and
several reliquaries containing the bones of early Gaulish
saints were shown as Æthelstan’s gifts, and the king himself
lay buried beneath the tower.<a id="Anchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 214.">[214]</a> On the left of the high altar,
facing <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Ealdhelm’s shrine, stood a tomb which in William’s
day was believed to cover the remains of a scholar of wider
though less happy fame than Ealdhelm himself—John
Scotus, who, flying from his persecutors in Gaul, was said to
have established a school under Ælfred’s protection at Malmesbury<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>,
and to have been there pricked to death by his
pupils with their styles in the little church of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Laurence.<a id="Anchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 215.">[215]</a>
The scanty traces of a vineyard on the hill-side which
sheltered the abbey to the north were associated with a
visitor from a yet more distant land. In the time of the
Danish kings there came seeking for admission at Malmesbury
a stranger of whom the brotherhood knew no more
than that he was a Greek and a monk, and that his name
was Constantine. His gentle disposition, abstemious habits,
and quiet retiring ways won him general esteem and love;
his whole time was spent in prayer and in the cultivation
of the vineyard which he planted with his own hands for
the benefit of the community; and only when at the point of
death he arrayed himself in a pallium drawn from the scrip
which he always carried at his side, was it revealed to the
astonished Englishmen that he had been an archbishop in
his Eastern home.<a id="Anchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 216.">[216]</a></p>

The story seems however to be false. It probably
originated in a confusion, first between John Scotus and John the Old-Saxon,
who was nearly murdered by the monks of Athelney; and secondly,
between both these Johns and a third scholar bearing the same name, who is
mentioned by Gotselin of Canterbury as buried at Malmesbury, but whose real

<p>Under the influence of surroundings such as these
William began his studies in English history. But he was
brought to a standstill at the very threshold for lack of a
guide. From the death of Bæda to his own day, he could
not by the most diligent researches discover a single English
writer worthy of the name of historian. “There are indeed
certain records of antiquity in the native tongue, arranged
according to the years of our Lord after the manner of a
chronicle, whereby the times which have gone by since that
great man (Bæda) have been rescued from complete oblivion.
For of Æthelweard, a noble and illustrious man who set
himself to expound those chronicles in Latin, it is better to
say nothing; his aim indeed would be quite to my mind,
if his style were not unbearable to my taste.”<a id="Anchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 217.">[217]</a> The work<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
of Florence was probably as yet altogether unpublished; it
was certainly not yet finished, nor does it appear to have
been heard of at Malmesbury. That of Eadmer, whose first
edition—ending at the death of Anselm—must have been
the last new book of the day, received from William a just
tribute of praise, both as to its subject-matter and its style;
but it was essentially what its title imported, a <i>History of
Recent Events</i>; the introductory sketch prefixed to it was
a mere outline, and, starting as it did only from Eadgar’s
accession, still left between its beginning and Bæda’s death
a yawning chasm of more than two centuries which the
young student at Malmesbury saw no means of bridging
over save by his own labour.<a id="Anchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 218.">[218]</a> “So, as I could not be

scribble myself.”<a id="Anchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 219.">[219]</a></p>

<p>Such, as related by the author himself, was the origin of
William’s first historical work, the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta Regum Anglorum</i>
or <i>Acts of the English Kings</i>, followed a few years later by a
companion volume devoted to the acts of the bishops. He
was stirred by the same impulse of revived national sentiment
which stirred Florence of Worcester to undertake his
version of the Chronicle. But the impulse acted very
differently on two different minds. William’s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta Regum</i>
were first published in 1120, two years after the death of
Florence. The work of Florence, although he never mentions
it, had doubtless reached him by this time, and must
certainly have been well known to him before he issued his
revised edition in 1128. To William, indeed, the Chronicle
had no need of a Latin interpreter; and he probably looked
upon Florence in no other light. He set before himself
a loftier aim. In his own acceptation of the word, he is the
first English historian since Bæda; he is in truth the
founder of a new school of historical composition. William’s
temper, as displayed in his works, might form the subject of
a curious psychological study. It is a temper which, in
many respects, seems to belong rather to a man of the
world in our own day than to a monk of the twelfth century<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>.
He has none of the narrowness of the cloister; he
has little of the prejudices common to his profession or his
age; he has still less prejudice of race. The Norman and
the English blood in his veins seem completely to neutralize
each other; while Florence colours the whole story not only
of the Norman but even of the Danish conquest with his
violent English sympathies, William calmly balances the one
side against the other, and criticizes them both with the
judicial impartiality of a spectator to whom the matter has a
purely philosophical interest. The whole bent of his mind
indeed is philosophical, literary, artistic, rather than political.
With him the study of history is a scientific study, and its
composition a work of art. His aim is to entertain his
readers quite as much as to instruct them. He utterly discards
the old arrangement of events “by the years of our
Lord,” and groups his materials in defiance of chronology
on whatever plan seems to him best adapted to set them in
the most striking and effective light. He never loses sight
of his reader; he is always in dread of wearying him with
dry political details, always seizing an opportunity to break
in upon their monotony with some curious illustration, some
romantic episode, some quaint legend, or—when he reaches
his own time—some personal scandal which he tells with
all the zest of a modern newspaper-writer. His love of
story-telling, his habit of flying off at a tangent in the midst
of his narrative and dragging in a string of irrelevant tales,
sometimes of the most frivolous kind, is positively irritating
to a student bent only upon following the main thread of
the history. But in William of Malmesbury the main thread
is often of less real value than the mass of varied adornment
and illustration with which it is overlaid. William is no
Bæda; but, Bæda excepted, there are few of our medieval
historians who can vie with him in the telling of a story.
His long and frequent digressions into foreign affairs are
often of great intrinsic value, and they show a depth of
insight into the history of other nations and a cosmopolitan
breadth of thought and feeling quite without
parallel in his time. His penetration into individual
characters, his power of seizing upon their main features<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
and sketching them to the life in a few rapid skilful
strokes—as in his pictures of the Norman kings or of the
Angevin counts—has perhaps not many rivals at any time.
Even when his stories are most utterly worthless in themselves,
there is a value in the light which they throw upon
the writer’s own temper or on that of the age in which he
lived. Not a few of them have a further interest as
fragments saved from the wreck of a popular literature
whose very existence, but for William and his fellow-historians,
we might never have known. The Norman
conquest had doomed to gradual extinction a vast growth
of unwritten popular verse which, making its way with the
wandering gleeman into palace and minster, hall and
cottage, had coloured the whole social life and thought of
England for four hundred years. The gleeman’s days were
numbered. He had managed to hold his ground against
the growing hostility of the Church; but the coming of
the stranger had fatally narrowed his sphere of influence.
His very language was unintelligible to the nobles who
sat in the seat of his former patrons; <i lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">jongleur</i> and
<i lang="xno" xml:lang="xno">ménestrel</i> from over sea had taken in the king’s court
and the baron’s castle the place which the gleeman had
once filled in the halls of ealdorman and thegn, and only
the common people still hailed his appearance as a
welcome break in the monotonous drudgery of their daily
life. Before his day was quite over, however, the new
school of patriotic historians had arisen; and they plunged
into the mass of traditional and romantic lore of which
he was the depositary as into a treasure-house from whose
stores they might fill up the gaps and deck the bare outlines
of the structure which they were building up on
the meagre foundations of the Chronicle. Florence was
the first to enter upon this somewhat dangerous process.
William drank more deeply of a stream whose source lay
at his own door: a simple English ballad which the
country-folk around Malmesbury in his day still chanted
as they went about their work was the spell by which
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Ealdhelm had drawn their forefathers to listen, first
to his singing and then to his preaching, four hundred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
years before.<a id="Anchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 220.">[220]</a> The same spell of song, handed on from
generation to generation, and passing from the gleeman’s
lips into the pages of the twelfth century historians
with William at their head, has transformed the story
of the later royal house of Wessex into a romance that
too often only serves to darken the true character of
the period which it professes to illustrate. What it does
illustrate is not the tenth century but the twelfth. It
helps us to learn something of the attitude of the national
revival towards the national past, by showing us the England
of Æthelstan and Eadmund, of Eadgar and Dunstan, not
as it actually was, but as it appeared to the England of
Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> and Roger of Sarum,—to the England of Florence
of Worcester, Henry of Huntingdon and William of
Malmesbury.</p>

<p>We must not take William as an average specimen of
the monastic culture and intelligence of his day. In any age
and in any circumstances he would probably have been a
man of exceptional genius. But his outward life and surroundings
were those of the ordinary monk of his time; and
those surroundings are set in a very striking light by the
fact, abundantly evident from his writings, that such a man
as William could feel himself thoroughly at home in them,
and could find in them full scope for the developement of his
powers. It was in truth precisely his monastic profession
which gave him opportunities of acquiring by personal
experience, even more than by wide reading, such a varied
and extensive knowledge of the world as could hardly be
obtained in any other circumstances. A very slight acquaintance
with William is enough to dispel all notions of the
medieval monk as a solitary student, a mere bookworm,
knowing no more of the world and of mankind than he could
learn from the beatings of his own heart and within the
narrow circle of the brotherhood among whom he dwelt. A
community like that of Malmesbury was in active and constant
relations with every rank and class of society all over
the kingdom. Its guest-hall stood open alike to king and
bishop, to Norman baron or English yeoman, to the high-born<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
pilgrim who came back from a distant shore laden with
relics and with tales of the splendours of Byzantium or the
marvels of Holy Land, to the merchant who came to sell his
curious foreign wares at the local fair and to pay his devotions,
like <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Godric, at the local shrine, as well as to the
monk of another house who came, perhaps, to borrow a book
from the library, to compare notes with the local history, or
to submit some literary question to the judgement of the
great local scholar, whoever he might happen to be. All the
political news, all the latest intellectual speculations, all the
social gossip of the day, found its way thither by one or
other of these channels, and was discussed within the safe
shelter of the inviolable convent-walls with a boldness and
freedom impossible amid the society of the outside world,
fettered by countless bonds of custom, interest, and mutual
dependence. The abbot ranked as a great noble who sat
among earls and bishops in the meetings of the Great Council,
whom they treated almost as an equal, and whom they
came, with a train of secular clerks and lay followers, to
visit and consult on matters of Church or state or of their
own personal interests. If the king himself chanced to pass
that way, it was matter of course that he should lodge in the
monastery. William’s vivid portraits of all the three Norman
kings were doubtless drawn, if not from the observation of
his own eyes, at any rate from that of his friend Abbot
Godfrey; his portrait of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> was in all likelihood
painted from life as the king paid his devotions before <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Ealdhelm’s shrine or feasted at the abbot’s table in the
refectory, or—quite as probably—as William, in his turn, sat
in the royal hall discussing some literary question with his
friend and patron, the king’s son Earl Robert of Gloucester,
if not actually with the king himself. The hospitality of
the abbey was repaid by that which greeted its brethren
wherever they went, on business for their house or for themselves.
The monk went in and out of castle or town, court
or camp, as a privileged person. Such a man as William,
indeed, might be sure of a welcome anywhere; and William,
indefatigable as a student, was almost equally so as a
traveller. The little sketches of town and country which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
illustrate his survey of the dioceses of England in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta
Pontificum</i> must have been made on the spot. He had seen
the marvels of Glastonbury;<a id="Anchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 221.">[221]</a> he had probably taken down
the legend of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Eadmund of East-Anglia on the very site of
the martyrdom;<a id="Anchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 222.">[222]</a> he had seen with his own eyes the Roman
walls of Carlisle, and heard with his own ears the rough
Yorkshire speech, of which, puzzling as it was to a southerner,
he yet learned enough to catch from some northern gleeman
the echo of Northumbria’s last heroic lay, the lay of
Waltheof at the gate of York;<a id="Anchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 223.">[223]</a> he had, we cannot doubt,
wandered with delight up that vale of Severn which he
paints in such glowing colours, and been drawn to write the
life of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Wulfstan by a sight of his church and his tomb at
Worcester. His own cell at Malmesbury was the garner in
which treasures new and old, of every kind, gathered from
one end of England to the other, were stored up to be sifted
and set in order at leisure amid that perfect tranquillity, that
absolute security from outward disturbance and worldly
care, which to the modern student is but a hopeless dream.</p>

<p>The new intellectual movement, however, was by no
means confined to the cloister. Clerk and layman had their
share in it; king and queen encouraged it warmly, and
their sympathy with the patriotic revival which animated it
was marked enough to excite the mockery of their Norman
courtiers, who nicknamed them “Godric and Godgifu.”<a id="Anchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 224.">[224]</a>
Learning and culture of every kind found a ready welcome
at the court; Henry never forgot the favourite maxim of his
youth, that “an unlettered king is but a crowned ass.”<a id="Anchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 225.">[225]</a> His
tastes were shared by his good queen Maude, who had
received in her aunt’s convent at Romsey such an education
as was probably given to few women of her time; and in
her later years, when the king’s manifold occupations beyond
sea left her alone in her palace at Westminster, the crowd of
poor and sick folk on whom she bestowed her boundless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
charities was almost equalled by that of the scholars and
poets who vied with each other to gain her ear by some new
feat of melody or of rime.<a id="Anchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 226.">[226]</a> Her stepson Earl Robert of
Gloucester was renowned as a scholar no less than as a
warrior and a statesman; to him William of Malmesbury
dedicated his chief historical works, as to a comrade and an
equal in the world of letters; it may even be that the
“Robert” of whom we once catch a glimpse, sitting in the
library at Malmesbury, eagerly turning over its treasures, and
suggesting plans of work to the willing friend at his side, is
no other than the king’s son.<a id="Anchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 227.">[227]</a> The secular clergy had no
mind to be outstripped by the regulars in literary activity;
Bishop Alexander of Lincoln, a nephew of the justiciar,
urged his archdeacon Henry of Huntingdon to compose a
<i>History of the English</i> in emulation of the <i>Gesta Regum</i>.
Nor did history alone absorb the intellectual energy of the
time. Natural science had its followers, among them the
king himself, who studied it in characteristically practical
fashion at Woodstock, where he kept a menagerie full of
lions, leopards, camels, lynxes and other strange beasts
collected from all parts of the world;<a id="Anchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 228.">[228]</a> and the “Bestiary”
of an Anglo-Norman poet, Philip de Thaun, found a
patroness in his second queen, Adeliza of Louvain. A
scholar of old English race, Adelard of Bath, carried his
researches into a wider field. Towards the close of the eleventh
century he had crossed the sea to study in the schools of Tours
and Laon. At the latter place he set up a school of his own,
but he soon quitted it to enter upon a long course of wandering
in distant lands. He crossed the Alps, made his way<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
to the great medical school at Salerno, thence into Greece
and Asia Minor, and finally, it seems, to the great centre of
Arab culture and learning at Bagdad, or what we now call
Cairo. Thence, after seven years’ absence, he returned to
England soon after the accession of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, and published
his first book, a philosophical allegory dedicated to Bishop
William of Syracuse, whose acquaintance he had made in his
travels. He next opened a school, apparently in Normandy,
for the diffusion of the scientific lore which he had acquired in
the East. He had picked up, among other things, an
Arabic version of Euclid, and the Latin translation which
he made of this became the text-book of all succeeding
mathematicians for centuries after. But his teaching of the
physical science of the East was vehemently opposed by
western scholars; his own nephew, who had been one of his
pupils at Laon, was among his opponents, and it was in the
shape of a discussion with this nephew that Adelard put
forth, under the title of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quæstiones Naturales</i>, a plea for a
more free inquiry into the principles of natural science,
instead of the blind following of old authorities which had
hitherto contented the scholars of the West.<a id="Anchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 229.">[229]</a> In the last
years of Henry’s reign he seems to have returned once more
to settle in his native land.<a id="Anchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 230.">[230]</a> His career shows how daring
was the spirit of enterprize now stirring among Englishmen,
and how vast was the range of study and experience now
thrown open to English scholars. We see that England was
already within reach of that wider world of which her
Angevin kings were soon to make her a part.</p>

<p>What gave scope for all this social, moral and intellectual
developement was, to borrow a phrase from the
Peterborough Chronicler, “the good peace” that Henry, like
his father, “made in this land.”<a id="Anchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 231.">[231]</a> The foundations of the
political and administrative system by which that peace was
preserved inviolate to the end of his reign were laid in the
three years succeeding the battle of Tinchebray—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
brightest period of Henry’s prosperity, and the only time
in his life when he himself could enjoy, on both sides of the
sea, the tranquillity which he fought to secure. In England,
indeed, from the day when he drove out Robert of Bellême
in 1103 to his own death in 1135, the peace was never
broken save by an occasional disturbance on the Welsh
border. Even in Wales, however, the settlement of the
Flemings and the appointment of a “Saxon” bishop to the
see of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> David’s<a id="Anchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 232.">[232]</a> were doing their work; and though in
Henry’s later years the restlessness of the Welsh princes
and people twice provoked him to march into their country,
the danger from them was never great enough to mar the
general security of the realm. From Scotland there was
still less to fear; its three successive kings, Eadgar, Alexander
and David, were the brothers of the good queen
Maude and the faithful allies of her husband. But in
Henry’s dominions beyond the sea, the state of things was
very different. In the duchy of Normandy the year 1110
saw the opening of a new phase of politics, the beginning of
a train of complications in which England seemed at the
moment less directly concerned than in the earlier struggles
between the king and the barons, but which in the end
exercised an important influence on the course of her after
history by bringing her into contact with the power of
Anjou. Before we can trace the steps whereby this came to
pass, we must change our line of thought and study. We
must turn aside from the well-worn track of English history
to travel awhile in less familiar paths; we must leave our
own land and make our way into the depths of Gaul; we
must go back from the broad daylight of the twelfth
century into the dim dawn of the ninth, there to seek out
the beginnings and thence to follow the romantic story of
the house of Anjou.</p>

<span class="ch2">THE BEGINNINGS OF ANJOU.</span><br />

<span class="ch3">843–987.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> cradle-land of our Angevin kings, the original county
of Anjou, was a small territory in central Gaul, lying
about the lower course of the river Loire and that of its
affluent the Mayenne<a id="Anchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 233.">[233]</a> or Maine. Its chief portion consisted
of a wedge-shaped tract hemmed in between the right
bank of the Loire, which bounded it on the south, and the
streams of Loir, Sarthe and Mayenne, which flowed round
it on the north and west; along its southern border stretched
a belt of alluvial soil which in winter and in rainy seasons
became a vast flood-drowned fen, swallowed up by the overflowing
waters of the Loire; to the northward, the country
consisted chiefly of level uplands broken here and there by
patches of forest and tiny river-valleys, and rising in the
west into a range of low hills, which again died down into a
fringe of swampy meadow-land along the eastern bank of
the Mayenne. A narrow strip of ground on the southern
bank of the Loire, with a somewhat wider strip of hilly and
wooded country beyond the Mayenne, completed the district
to which its earliest known inhabitants, a Gallic tribe called
Andes or Andegavi, have left their name. A few miles
above the angle formed by the confluence of the two rivers,
a lofty mass of black slate rock thrown out from the upland<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98">98</a></span>
furnished a ready-made fortress important alike by its
natural strength and by its geographical position, commanding
the main lines of communication with central,
northern and southern Gaul through the valleys of the Loire
and its tributaries. Under the Roman conquerors of Gaul
the place was called Juliomagus; the hill was crowned by a
lofty citadel, and strengthened by a circuit of rampart walls;
while from its crest a road struck eastward along Loire-side
into the heart of central Gaul, another followed the westward
course of the river to its junction with the sea, and
others struck southward and northward into Aquitania and
across the upland into the basin of the Seine. In the
middle of the fourth century a Christian bishop, probably
one of a band of mission-preachers who shared with the
famous <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin of Tours the work of evangelizing central
Gaul, laid beside the citadel of Juliomagus the foundations
of a church, which in after-time grew into the cathedral of
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Maurice; and it is from the extent of the diocese over
which his successors ruled that we learn the extent of the
civil jurisdiction of Juliomagus. A later bishop, Albinus,
left his name to the great abbey of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Aubin, founded in
Merovingian days on the slope of the hill just outside the
city wall; a monastery dedicated to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Sergius grew up to
the north, in a low-lying marshy meadow by the river-side;
while the place of the Roman prefects was taken by a succession
of Frankish counts, the delegates first of the Merovingian
kings of Neustria and then of the Karolingian
emperors; and the Roman name of Juliomagus itself gave
way to a native appellation cognate with that of the district
of which it was the head—“Andegavis,” Angers.<a id="Anchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 234.">[234]</a></p>

From the point where the Sarthe joins it, this river is now called the Maine.
In the middle ages it had but one name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Meduana</i>, from its source to its junction
with the Loire. The old nomenclature is far more convenient for historical

<p>City and county acquired a new importance through the
political arrangements by which the Karolingian realms were
divided between the three sons of the Emperor Louis the
Gentle. By a treaty made at Verdun in 843, the original
Frankish kingdom and its Saxon dependencies, answering
roughly to what we call Germany now-a-days, fell to the
second brother Louis; the Gallic conquests of the Franks,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99">99</a></span>
between the Moselle, the Rhone, the Pyrenees and the
ocean, were the share of the youngest, Charles the Bald;
while the necessity that the eldest brother Lothar, as Emperor,
should hold the two capitals, Rome and Aachen,
involved the creation in his favour of a middle kingdom
consisting of a long narrow string of countries reaching from
the Frisian to the Pontine marshes. Although the limits
thus fixed were afterwards altered more than once, the main
lines of this treaty left indelible traces, and from that day
we may date the beginning of modern France and modern
Germany. The tripartite division, however, was soon overthrown
by the extinction of the elder or Lotharingian line;
the incongruous middle kingdom fell asunder and became a
bone of furious contention between its two neighbours, and
the imperial crown itself was soon an object of rivalry no
less fierce. On the other hand, the extent of territory
actually subject to Charles the Bald fell far short of the
limits assigned to him by the treaty. Even Charles the
Great had scarcely been able to maintain more than a nominal
sway over the vast region which stretched from the southern
shores of the Loire to the Pyrenees and the Mediterranean
Sea, and was known by the general name of Aquitania; its
princes and its people, wrapped in the traditions of Roman
culture and Roman greatness, held disdainfully aloof from
the barbarian conquerors of the north, and remained utterly
indifferent to claims of supremacy which each succeeding
Karolingian found it more and more hopeless to enforce.
To the west, again, in the peninsula of Britanny or Armorica,
the ancient Celtic race preserved, as in the Welsh hills of
our own island, its native tongue, its primitive laws and
customs, and its separate political organization under a
dynasty of native princes who owed, indeed, a nominal allegiance
to the West-Frankish overlord at Laon, but whose
subjection to him was scarcely more real than that of the
princes of Aquitania, while their disaffection was far more
active and far more threatening; for the pirate fleets of the
northmen were now hovering about the coast of Gaul as
about that of Britain; and the Celts of the Breton peninsula,
like the West-Welsh of Cornwall, were ever ready to make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
common cause with these marauders against the Teutonic
conquerors of the land.</p>

<p>The work of the northmen in West-Frankland was a
work both of union and disunion. There, as in England,
the need for organization and defence against their attacks
produced a new upgrowth of national life; but while in England
this life was moulded by the consolidation of the earlier
Engle and Saxon realms into a single state under the leadership
of the West-Saxon kings, in Frankland it was created
through the forcible breaking-up of an outward unity already
threatened with the doom which never fails sooner or later to
overtake a kingdom divided against itself. The West-Frankish
king was not, like the king of Wessex, the leader,
the natural exponent, the impersonation almost, of the dawning
national consciousness; it was not he who led and organized
the struggle for existence against the northern foe;
the nation had to fight for itself, with but little help from its
sovereign. This difference was caused partly by the political
circumstances of the Karolingian realms, partly by geographical
conditions. The brunt of the battle necessarily
fell, not upon the royal domains lying far from the sea
around the inland fortress of Laon, but on the coast, and
especially on the districts around the great river-inlets by
which the pirates made their entrance into the country. Of
these, the estuary of the Seine lay nearest to them, and
was their first point of attack. Between it and the other
great inlet, the mouth of the Loire, lay the Breton peninsula;
once round that, and the broad lands of Aquitania, rich with
the natural wealth of a southern soil and with the remains of
a luxury and splendour in which its cities had almost outdone
Rome herself, would tempt the northmen with a fairer
harvest of spoil than they could find on the shores of the
Channel. The desolate rocky coast and barren moorlands
of the intervening peninsula offered little chance of booty;
but if the pirates could secure the alliance or even the
neutrality of the Bretons, they had but to force an entrance
into the Loire, and not only Aquitaine, but the inmost heart
of the West-Frankish realm would be laid open to their
attacks. Two barriers, however, would have to be overcome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
before such an entrance could be gained. The first was the
city of Nantes, which stood on the northern bank of the
Loire, some thirty miles above its mouth. Politically, Nantes
was the extreme western outpost of the Karolingian power,
for its count held his fief directly of the king at Laon, not of
the nearer Breton under-king at Rennes; but by its geographical
position and the character of its people it was far
more Breton than Frankish. The true corner-stone of the
West-Frankish realm lay on the other side of the Mayenne.
The county of Anjou or “Angevin march,” the border-land
of Neustria and Aquitaine, was for all practical purposes the
border-land also of Neustria and of Britanny. Angers, with
its Roman citadel and its Roman walls, perched on the crest
of its black slate-rock, at once guarding and guarded by the
two rivers which flowed round its foot, was a far mightier
fortress than Nantes; Angers, rather than Nantes, was the
true key of the Loire valley, and the stronghold of the
Neustrian border against all attacks from the west, whether
by land or by sea.</p>

<p>In the first days of Charles the Bald, when the new king
was struggling with his brothers, and the pirate ships were
beginning again to strike terror into the coasts of Gaul,
Lambert, a Breton-born count of the Angevin march, sought
from Charles the investiture of the neighbouring and recently-vacated
county of Nantes. On the refusal of his
demand, he threw off his allegiance, offered his services to
the Breton king Nomenoë, and on failing to obtain the
coveted prize by his help, called in that of a pirate fleet which
was cruising about the shores of Britanny. It was thus at
the invitation and under the guidance of a man who had
been specially intrusted with its defence that the northmen
made their first entrance into the hitherto peaceful estuary
of the Loire. Nantes was stormed and sacked;<a id="Anchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 235.">[235]</a> the desolate
city was left in the hands of Lambert and the Bretons, and
the ravagers sailed away, probably to swell the forces and
share the spoil of a fleet which in the following year made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
its way to the estuary of the Garonne, and pushed inland as
far as Toulouse. Nearly ten years passed away before the
northmen repeated their dash upon central Gaul. The
valley of the Seine and the city of Paris were the victims of
their next great expedition, in 845; and a series of plundering
raids upon the Aquitanian coast were crowned in 848 by
the conquest of Bordeaux. For a moment, in 851, the fury
of the pirates’ attack seemed to be turning away from Gaul
to spend itself on Britain; but a great victory of the West-Saxons
under Æthelwulf at Aclea threw them back upon
their old field of operations across the Channel, and in the
terror of their threatened onset Charles sought to detach the
Bretons from their alliance by a formal cession of the
counties of Rennes and Nantes and the district west of the
Mayenne, which had passed into Breton hands by the
treason of Count Lambert.<a id="Anchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 236.">[236]</a> His precautions failed to avert
the blow which he dreaded. Next year the pirates made
their way back again round the Armorican coast, up the
mouth of the Loire, past Nantes, and through the Angevin
march—now shrunk to a little corner of territory wedged in
between the Mayenne and the Loire—as far inland as Tours,
where they sacked and burned the abbey of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin and
drove its canons into exile with the hardly-rescued body of
their patron saint.<a id="Anchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 237.">[237]</a></p>

<p>In a breathing-space which followed upon this last attack,
Charles received from Æthelwulf of Wessex a personal
visit and an overture of mutual alliance against the common
foe. The scheme was shattered by a political revolution in
Wessex which followed Æthelwulf’s return; and meanwhile
a new danger to the Karolingian power arose in the
threatening attitude of Robert the Brave, a warrior of
obscure birth who was now count of the Angevin march.
Under pretext, as it seems, of securing their aid against the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
northmen, Robert leagued himself with the foes of the
monarchy beyond his two frontier rivers, and made a triple
alliance with the revolted Bretons and the king’s rebel
nephew, Pepin of Aquitaine.<a id="Anchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 238.">[238]</a> Charles, more and more hard
pressed every year by domestic and political difficulties, and
haunted by the perpetual horror of the pirate ships always
in the background, felt that this second wavering lord of the
marchland must be won back at any cost. Two years later,
therefore, the count of the Angevin march was invested with
a vast duchy comprising the whole territory between Seine
and Loire as far as the sea and the Breton border; and with
this grant the special work of keeping out both Bretons and
northmen was distinctly laid upon his shoulders.<a id="Anchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 239.">[239]</a></p>

<p>Robert fulfilled his trust gallantly and successfully till he
fell in a Scandinavian ambush at Brissarthe in 866.<a id="Anchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 240.">[240]</a> His
territories were given to a cousin of the king, Hugh of
Burgundy, who was either so incapable or so careless of their
defence that before six years had passed he suffered the
very corner-stone of his duchy, the most important point in
the whole scheme of operations against the northmen in
central Gaul, to fall into the enemies’ hands. A band of
pirates, sailing unopposed up the Loire and the Mayenne after
Robert’s death, found Angers deserted and defenceless, and
settling there with their families, used it as a centre from
which they could securely harry all the country round. The
bulk of the pirate forces, however, was now concentrated
upon a great effort for the conquest of Britain, and while the
invaders of Angers lay thus isolated from their brethren
across the Channel, Charles the Bald seized his opportunity
to attempt the recovery of the city. In concert with the
Breton king, Solomon, he gathered his forces for a siege; the
Franks encamped on the eastern side of the Mayenne, the
Bretons on the opposite shore. Their joint blockade proved
unavailing, till one of the Bretons conceived the bold idea of
turning the course of the Mayenne, so as to leave the pirate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
ships stranded and useless. The whole Breton army at once
set to work and dug such an enormous trench that the
northmen saw their retreat would be hopelessly cut off. In
dismay they offered to purchase, at a heavy price, a free
withdrawal from Angers and its district; their offer was
accepted, and Angers was evacuated accordingly.<a id="Anchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 241.">[241]</a></p>

<p>But the long keels sailed away only to return again.
Amid the gathering troubles of the Karolingian house, as
years passed on, the cry rose up ever louder and louder from
the desolated banks of Seine, and at last even from the
inland cities of Reims and Soissons, perilously near the royal
abode at Laon itself: “From the fury of the northmen, good
Lord, deliver us!” It was not from Laon that deliverance
was to come. The success of Charles the Bald at Angers,
the more brilliant victory of his grandson Louis <abbr title="3">III.</abbr> over
Guthrum at Saucourt, were but isolated triumphs which produced
no lasting results. At the very moment when the
Karolingian empire was reunited under the sceptre of Charles
the Fat came the crisis of the struggle with the northmen in
West-Frankland; and the true national leader shewed himself
not in the heir of Charles the Great, but in Count Odo
of Paris, the son of Robert the Brave. It was Odo who
saved Paris from the northmen when they besieged it with
all their forces throughout the winter of 885; and by saving
Paris he saved the kingdom. Before the siege was raised
the possessions which his father had held as duke of the
French were restored to him by the death of Hugh of
Burgundy. A few months later the common consent of all
the Karolingian realms deposed their unworthy Emperor,
and the acclamations of a grateful people raised their deliverer
Odo to the West-Frankish throne.</p>

<p>The times, however, were not yet ripe for a change of
dynasty, and the revolution was followed by a reaction which
on Odo’s death in 898 again set a Karolingian, Charles the
Simple, upon the throne; but though the monarchy of Laon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
lingered on till the race of Charles the Great became extinct,
it was being gradually undermined and supplanted by the
dukes of the French, the rulers of the great duchy between
Seine and Loire. Paris was now, since the siege of 885,
the chief seat of the ducal power; and in the new feudal
organization which grew up around this centre, the cradle of
the ducal house, the border-stronghold of Angers, sank to a
secondary position. The fiefs which the dukes parcelled out
among their followers fell to the share of men of the most
diverse origin and condition. In some cases, as at Chartres
and Tours, the Scandinavian settler was turned into a peaceful
lieutenant of the Frankish chief against whom he had
fought. In others the reward of valour was justly bestowed
on men who had earned it by their prowess against the
invaders. It may be that the old alliance of Count Robert
the Brave with the Bretons had sowed the seeds of a mighty
tree. In the depths of a gloomy forest-belt which ran along
the Breton border at the foot of a range of hills that shelter
the western side of the valley of the Mayenne, there dwelt
in Robert’s day—so the story went—a valiant forester,
Tortulf. He quitted the hardy, hazardous borderer’s life—half
hunter, half bandit—to throw himself into the struggle
of Charles the Bald and Robert the Brave against the northmen:
Charles set him to keep the pirates out of Touraine,
and gave him a congenial post as forester of a wooded district
known as the “Nid-de-Merle”—the Blackbird’s Nest.
In its wild fastnesses Tortulf lay in wait for the approach of
the marauders, and sprang forth to meet them with a daring
and a success which earned him his sovereign’s favour and
the alliance of the duke of the French. His son, Ingelger,
followed in his steps; marriage came to the help of arms,
and with the hand of Ælendis, niece of the archbishop of
Tours, Ingelger acquired her lands at Amboise. The dowry
was a valuable one; Amboise stood in the midst of one of
the most rich and fertile districts of central France, half way
between Tours and Blois, on the south bank of the Loire,
which was spanned at this point by a bridge said to have
been built by Julius Cæsar; two centuries later tradition
still pointed out the site of Cæsar’s palace on the banks of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
the little river Amasse, at the western end of the town;
while opposite the bridge a rocky brow, crowned to-day by
the shell of a magnificent castle of the Renascence, probably
still kept in Ingelger’s days some traces of a fortress built
there by a Roman governor in the reign of the Emperor
Valens. A mightier stronghold than Amboise, however, was
to be the home of Ingelger’s race. His son, a ruddy youth
named Fulk, early entered the service of Count Odo of
Paris and remained firmly attached to him and his house;
and one of the earliest acts of Odo’s brother Robert, who
succeeded him as duke of the French—if indeed it was not
rather one of the last acts of King Odo himself—was to
intrust the city of Angers to Fulk the Red as viscount.<a id="Anchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 242.">[242]</a>
The choice was a wise one; for Fulk was gifted with a
sound political instinct which found and kept the clue to
guide him through all the revolutions and counter-revolutions
of the next forty years. He never swerved from his adherence
to the dukes of the French; and by his quiet tenacity
he, like them, laid the foundation of his house’s greatness.
Preferments civil and ecclesiastical—the abbacies of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Aubin
and <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Licinius at Angers, the viscounty of Tours, though this
was but a momentary honour—were all so many stepping-stones
to his final investiture, shortly before the death of
Charles the Simple, as count of the Angevin March.</p>

<p>This little county of Anjou, of which Fulk thus became
the first hereditary count, ended by overshadowing in political
importance all the other divisions which made up the duchy
of France. In point of territorial extent Anjou, at its present
stage, was one of the smallest of the under-fiefs of the
duchy. The dominions of Theobald the Trickster, the first
count of Blois and Chartres, were far larger than those of
Fulk; and so was the county of Maine or Cenomannia,
which lay to the north of Anjou on the right bank of the
Loire. Yet in a few generations Blois and Maine were both
alike outstripped by the little Angevin march. The proud
independence of Maine proved her ruin as well as her glory.
She too was a border-land; her western frontier marched
with that of Britanny, her northern with that of a great<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
Scandinavian settlement which was growing into the duchy
of Normandy. But her political status was altogether undefined
and insecure. France and Normandy alike claimed
the overlordship of Maine; Maine herself acknowledged the
claims of neither; and this uncertain condition placed her
at the mercy of her neighbours to north and south, and made
her a bone of contention between them and a battle-ground
for their quarrels till the day when all three were united.
Blois and Chartres, on the other hand, with their dependency
Touraine, stood like Anjou on a perfectly definite footing as
recognised under-fiefs of the duchy of France. In the extent
of their territory, and in the natural resources derived
from the fertility of its soil and the number and wealth of
its towns, the counts of Blois had at starting a very considerable
advantage over the Angevins. But this seeming advantage
proved in a few years to be a disadvantage. The
house of Blois grew too fast, and soon outgrew its strength;
its dominions became straggling; and when they straggled
out eastward into Champagne, what was gained at one end
was lost at the other, and Touraine, the most precious
possession of the counts of Blois, was absorbed in the
gradual steady advance of the Angevins.</p>

<p>Anjou’s position as a marchland marked her out for a
special career. Forming the extreme south-western corner
of France properly so called, divided from Aquitania by the
Loire, from Britanny by the Mayenne, she had the advantage
of a strong and compact geographical situation to start with.
Her political position was equally favourable; she was
neither hindered and isolated like Maine by a desperate
endeavour to reclaim a lost independence, nor led astray by
a multiplicity of scattered interests like Blois. She had
simply to take her choice between the two alternatives which
lie before every marchland. Such a land must either submit
to be swallowed up piecemeal by its neighbours, or it must
in sheer self-defence swallow up some of them; to keep
what it has got, it must get more. Anjou, as represented
by Fulk the Red and his successors, strongly embraced this
latter alternative. The growth of the Angevin power during
the next two centuries was due chiefly to the character of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
its rulers, working in a sphere which gave exceptional scope
for the exercise of their peculiar gifts. Whoever Fulk’s real
ancestors may have been, there can be no question that his
descendants were a very remarkable race. From first to
last there is a strong family likeness among them all. The
first thing that strikes one about them is their thoroughness;
whatsoever their hands found to do, whether it were good or
evil, they did it with all their might. Nearly all of them
were men of great and varied natural powers, gifted with a
lofty military capacity and a deep political insight, and with
a taste and a talent for all kinds of pursuits, into which they
threw themselves with the full ardour of their stirring, restless
temper. Daring, but not rash; persevering, watchful,
tenacious; sometimes seeming utterly unscrupulous, yet with
an odd vein of irregular piety running through the characters
of many of them, and coming to light in the strangest
shapes and at the most unexpected moments; passionate
almost as madmen, but with a method in their madness—the
Angevin counts were patriots in their way; for their
chief aim was aggrandizement, but it was the aggrandizement
of Anjou as well as of themselves. They were not
to be led away, like their rivals of Blois, by visionary schemes
of merely personal promotion involving neglect of their own
little home-county; they were proud and fond of their
“black Angers” on its steep above the Mayenne, and never
forgot that there was the centre whence their power was to
spread to the ends of the earth. It is easy to see how
exactly such a race as this was fitted for its post in Anjou.
Given such men in such a place, we can scarcely wonder at
what they made of it.</p>

<p>The Angers in which Fulk came to rule as count, about
the time when Æthelstan succeeded Eadward the Elder as
king of Wessex, was a town not of dark slate walls as it is
chiefly now, but of red flintstone and redder brick, such as
the medieval builders long copied from the works of their
Roman masters, and such as may still be found embedded
in the outer walls of the bishop’s palace and half hidden
behind the mighty black bastions of the later castle. That
castle covers, or rather encloses, the site of a hall which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
Count Odo, the successor of the traitor Lambert, had built
about the year 851 on ground acquired by exchange with
Bishop Dodo. For some time after Frankish counts had
been substituted for Roman prefects, the spiritual and
temporal rulers of Angers had continued to dwell side by
side on the hill-top; Odo, however, instead of again occupying
the palace which Lambert had deserted, made it over
to the bishop in return for a plot of ground lying just
outside the south-west corner of the city wall. There he
built himself a house, with the river at its feet and a vine-clad
hill at its back; and there from that time forth was
the dwelling-place of the Angevin counts.<a id="Anchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 243.">[243]</a> Fulk the Red
took up his abode there in the early days of a great political
transition which was to change the kingdom of the West-Franks
into a kingdom of Parisian France. Half a century
had yet to elapse before the transition was accomplished;
at its present stage indeed few could foresee its ultimate
issue. If the ducal house of Paris had many friends, it had
also many foes. The old Karolingian nobility was slowly
dying out or sinking into the background before the new
nobility of the sword; the great house of Vermandois had
thrown its weight into the scale with the advancing power;
but there were still many who looked with contempt and
disgust on the new order of things, on the house of Paris
and all its connexions. The count of Anjou was wedged
in between powers anything but favourably disposed towards
him and his patrons. The princes of Aquitania looked
scornfully across the Loire at the upstarts on its northern
bank; little as they recked of any authority beyond their
river-barrier, the only one which they acknowledged at all
was that of the Karolingian king at Laon. The Bretons
beyond the Mayenne were as far from being subdued as ever.
Within the duchy of France itself, one little corner was
equally scornful of the dukes and of their partisans; Maine,
although from its geographical position necessarily reckoned
part of the duchy “between Seine and Loire,” still refused
to acknowledge any such reckoning; its ruling house, as
well as the great nobles of the South, claimed to have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
inherited the traditions of the Roman Empire and the blood
of its Frankish conquerors. In the eyes of the Cenomannian
counts, who traced their pedigree from a nephew of Charles
the Great, the heirs of Tortulf the Forester were nothing but
upstart barbarians.</p>

<p>Their disdain, however, mattered little to Fulk. In those
critical times, he who had the keenest sword, the strongest
arm, the clearest head and the boldest heart, had the best
title to nobility—a title whose validity all were sooner or
later compelled to acknowledge. Fulk held Anjou by the
grace of God, the favour of his lord the duke, and the might
of his own good sword. He was, however, no mere man of
war; he was quite willing to strengthen his position by
peaceful means. One method of so doing was suggested by
his father’s example; it was one which in all ages finds
favour with ambitious men of obscure origin, and which was
to be specially characteristic of the Angevin house. As
Ingelger had married Ælendis of Amboise, so Fulk sought
and won the hand of another maiden of Touraine, Roscilla,
the daughter of Warner, lord of Loches, Villentras and
Haye. It can only have been as the dowry of his wife that
Fulk came into possession of the most valuable portion of
her father’s lands, the township of Loches.<a id="Anchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 244.">[244]</a> It lay some
twenty miles south of Amboise, on the left bank of the
Indre, a little river which takes its rise in the plains of Berry
and winds along a wooded valley, through some of the most
romantic scenery of southern Touraine, to fall into the Loire
about half way between Amboise and Angers. In a loop of
the river, sheltered on the south and west by a belt of
woodland which for centuries to come was a favourite
hunting-ground of Roscilla’s descendants, rose a pyramidal
height of rock on whose steep sides the houses of the little
township clustered round a church said to have been built
in the sixth century by a holy man from southern Gaul,
named Ursus, the “<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Ours” whom Loches still venerates
as its patron saint.<a id="Anchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 245.">[245]</a> By the acquisition of Loches Fulk had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
gained in the heart of southern Touraine a foot-hold which,
coupled with that which he already possessed at Amboise,
might one day serve as a basis for the conquest of the whole
district.</p>

<p>A few years before Fulk’s investiture as count of Anjou,
the relations between the West-Frankish kingdom and its
northern foes had entered upon a new phase. In 912
King Charles the Simple and Duke Hugh of Paris, finding
themselves unable to wrest back from a pirate leader called
Hrolf the Ganger the lands which he had won around the
mouth of the Seine, made a virtue of necessity, and by a
treaty concluded at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>-Clair-sur-Epte granted to Hrolf a
formal investiture of his conquest, on condition of homage
to the king and conversion to the Christian faith. Tradition
told how a rough Danish soldier, bidden to perform the
homage in Hrolf’s stead, kissed indeed the foot of Charles
the Simple, but upset him and his throne in doing so; and
although to the declining Karolingian monarchy the new
power thus established at the mouth of the Seine was useful
as a counterpoise to that of the Parisian dukes, yet the story
is not altogether an inapt parable of the relations between
the duchy of Normandy and its royal overlord during several
generations. The homage and the conversion of Hrolf and
his comrades were alike little more than nominal. His son,
William Longsword, strove hard to force upon his people
the manners, the tongue, the outward civilization of their
French neighbours; but to those neighbours even he was
still only a “leader of the pirates.” The plundering, burning,
slaughtering raids did indeed become less frequent and less
horrible under him than they had been in his father’s heathen
days; but they were far from having ceased. Politically indeed
it was William’s support alone that enabled Charles the Simple
to carry on to his life’s end a fairly successful struggle with
a rival claimant of his crown, Rudolf of Burgundy, a brother-in-law
of Hugh, duke of the French. No sooner was Charles
dead and Rudolf seated on his throne than the hostility of
the northmen to the new king broke out afresh in a pirate-raid
which swept across the Norman border, past Orléans
and through the Gâtinais, into the very heart of the kingdom,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112">112</a></span>
to the abbey of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Benedict at Fleury on the Loire. It was
not the first time the monastery had been ravaged by
pirates; the abbot was now evidently expecting their attack,
for he had called to his aid Count Gilbald of Auxerre and
Ingelger of Anjou, Fulk’s eldest son, who, young as he was,
had already made himself a name in battle with the northmen.
The fight was a stubborn one; the defenders of
Fleury had resolved to maintain it to their last gasp, and
when at length all was over there was scarcely a man of
them left to tell the tale. The young heir of Anjou, taken
prisoner by the pirates, was slaughtered beneath the shadow
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Benet’s abbey as Count Robert the Brave had been
slaughtered long ago at the bridge of Sarthe.<a id="Anchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 246.">[246]</a> Fortunately,
however, the future of the Angevin house did not depend
solely on the life thus cut off in its promise. Two sons yet
remained to Fulk. The duty of stepping into Ingelger’s
place fell upon the youngest, for the second, Guy, was
already in holy orders. Eight years later, in 937, Duke
Hugh of Paris, the great maker of kings and bishops, who
had just restored Louis From-over-sea to the throne of his
father Charles the Simple, procured Guy’s elevation to the
see of Soissons.<a id="Anchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 247.">[247]</a> The son’s promotion was doubtless owed
to the long and steady service of the father; but the young
bishop soon shewed himself worthy of consideration on his
own account. He played a conspicuous part in the politics
of his time, both ecclesiastical and secular; he adhered
firmly to the party of Duke Hugh and his brother-in-law
Herbert of Vermandois, and even carried his devotion to
them so far as to consecrate Herbert’s little son Hugh, a
child six years old, to the archbishopric of Reims in 940;<a id="Anchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 248.">[248]</a>
and through all the scandals and censures which naturally
resulted from this glaringly uncanonical appointment Guy
stuck to his boy-archbishop with a courage worthy of a
better cause. He could, however, shew zeal for the Karolingian
king as well as for the Parisian duke. When in 945<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113">113</a></span>
Louis From-beyond-sea fell a prisoner into the hands of the
Normans, they demanded as the condition of his release that
his two sons should be given them as hostages. On Queen
Gerberga’s refusal to trust them with her eldest boy, the
bishop of Soissons offered himself in the child’s stead, and
the Normans, well knowing his importance in the realm,
willingly accepted the substitution.<a id="Anchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 249.">[249]</a> The dauntless Angevin
was possibly more at home in the custody of valiant enemies
than amid the ecclesiastical censures which fell thick upon
him for his proceedings in connexion with Hugh of Reims,
and from which he was only absolved in 948 by the synod
of Trier.<a id="Anchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 250.">[250]</a> His father was then no longer count of Anjou.
A year after Hugh’s consecration, in the winter of 941 or
the early spring of 942, Fulk the Red died “in a good old
age,” leaving the marchland which his sword had won and
guarded so well to his youngest son, Fulk the Good.<a id="Anchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 251.">[251]</a></p>

<p>The reign of the second Count Fulk is the traditional
golden age of Anjou. Under him, she is the proverbially
happy land which has no history. While the name of the
bishop of Soissons is conspicuous in court and camp, that of
his brother the count is never once heard; he waged no
wars,<a id="Anchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 252.">[252]</a> he took no share in politics; the annalists of the time
find nothing to record of him. But if there is no history,
there is plenty of tradition and legend to set before us a
charming picture of the Good Count’s manner of life. The
arts he cultivated were those of peace; his gentle disposition
and refined taste led him to pursuits and habits which in
those rough days were almost wholly associated with the
clerical profession. His favourite place of retirement, the
special object of his reverence and care, was the church of
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin at Châteauneuf by Tours. There were enshrined
the relics of the “Apostle of the Gauls”; after many a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114">114</a></span>
journey to and fro, many a narrow escape from the sacrilegious
hands of the northmen, they had been finally brought
back to their home, so local tradition said, under the care of
Fulk’s grandfather Ingelger. The church was now a collegiate
foundation, served by a body of secular canons under
the joint control of a dean and—according to an evil usage
of the period—a lay-abbot who had only to enjoy his
revenues on pretence of watching over the temporal interests
of the church. Since the time of Hugh of Burgundy the
abbacy of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin’s had always been held by the head of
the ducal house of France; and it was doubtless their influence
which procured a canonry in their church for Fulk
of Anjou. His greatest delight was to escape from the
cares of government and go to keep the festival of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin
with the chapter of Châteauneuf; there he would lodge in
the house of one or other of the clergy, living in every
respect just as they did, and refusing to be called by his
worldly title; not till after he was gone did the count take
care to make up for whatever little expense his host might
have incurred in receiving the honorary canon.<a id="Anchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 253.">[253]</a> While there
he diligently fulfilled the duties of his office, never failing to
take his part in the sacred services. He was not only a
scholar, he was a poet, and had himself composed anthems
in honour of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin.<a id="Anchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 254.">[254]</a> One Martinmas eve King Louis
From-beyond-sea came to pay his devotions at the shrine of
the patron saint of Tours. As he and his suite entered the
church at evensong, there they saw Fulk, in his canon’s
robe, sitting in his usual place next the dean, and chanting
the Psalms, book in hand. The courtiers pointed at him
mockingly—“See, the count of Anjou has turned clerk!”
and the king joined in their mockery. The letter which the
“clerk” wrote to Louis, when their jesting came round to
his ears, has passed into a proverb: “Know, my lord, that
an unlettered king is but a crowned ass.”<a id="Anchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 255.">[255]</a> Fulk was indeed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115">115</a></span>
a living proof that it is possible to make the contemplative
life of the scholar a help and not a hindrance to the active
life of the statesman. The poet-canon was no mere dreamer;
he was a practical, energetic ruler, who worked hard at the
improvement and cultivation, material as well as intellectual,
of his little marchland, rebuilding the churches and the towns
that had been laid waste by the northmen, and striving to
make up for the losses sustained during the long years of
war. The struggle was completely over now; a great victory
of King Rudolf, in the year after Ingelger’s death,<a id="Anchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 256.">[256]</a> had finally
driven the pirates from the Loire; and there was nothing to
hinder Fulk’s work of peace. The soil had grown rich
during the years it had lain fallow, and now repaid with an
abundant harvest the labours of the husbandman; the report
of its fertility and the fame of Fulk’s wise government soon
spread into the neighbouring districts; and settlers from all
the country round came to help in re-peopling and cultivating
the marchland.<a id="Anchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 257.">[257]</a> This idyl of peace lasted for twenty years,
and ended only with the life of Fulk. In his last years he
became involved in the intricacies of Breton politics, and
storm-clouds began to gather on his western border; but
they never broke over Anjou itself till the Good Count was
gone.</p>

<p>The old Breton kingdom had now sunk into a duchy
which was constantly a prey to civil war. The ruling house
of the counts of Nantes were at perpetual strife with their
rivals of Rennes. Alan Barbetorte, count of Nantes, had
been compelled to flee the country and take shelter in
England, at the general refuge of all exiles, the court of
Æthelstan, till a treaty between Æthelstan’s successor
Eadmund and Louis From-over-sea restored him to the
dukedom of Britanny for the rest of his life. He died in
952, leaving his duchy and his infant son Drogo to the care
of his wife’s brother, Theobald, count of Blois and Chartres,
a wily, unscrupulous politician known by the well-deserved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
epithet of “the Trickster,” who at once resolved to turn his
brother-in-law’s dying charge to account for purposes of his
own. But between his own territories and the Breton duchy
lay the Angevin march; his first step therefore must be to
make a friend of its ruler. For this end a very simple
means presented itself. Fulk’s wife had left him a widower
with one son;<a id="Anchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 258.">[258]</a> Theobald offered him the hand of his sister,
the widow of Alan, and with it half the city and county of
Nantes, to have and to hold during Drogo’s minority; while
he gave the other half to the rival claimant of the duchy,
Juhel Berenger of Rennes, under promise of obedience to
himself as overlord.<a id="Anchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 259.">[259]</a> Unhappily, the re-marriage of Alan’s
widow was soon followed by the death of her child. In
later days Breton suspicion laid the blame upon his step-father;
but the story has come down to us in a shape so
extremely improbable that it can leave no stain on the
memory of the Good Count.<a id="Anchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 260.">[260]</a> Two sons of Alan, both much
older than Drogo, still remained. But they were not sons
of Drogo’s mother; Fulk therefore might justly think himself
entitled to dispute their claims to the succession, and
hold that, in default of lawful heirs, the heritage of Duke
Alan should pass, as the dowry of the widow, to her second
husband—a practice very common in that age. And Fulk
would naturally feel his case strengthened by the fact that
part at least of the debateable land—that is, nearly half the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
territory between the Mayenne and Nantes itself—had once
been Angevin ground.</p>

The <abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicon Briocense">Chron. Brioc.</abbr> (Morice, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Histoire de Bretagne, preuves">Hist. Bret., preuves</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="column">col.</abbr> 30) tells how
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ille comes Fulco Andegavensis, vir diabolicus et maledictus</span>,” bribed the child’s
nurse to kill him by pouring boiling water on his head when she was giving him a
bath. The fact that the Angevin count is further described as “Fulco Rufus”
    (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="column">col.</abbr> 29</cite>), would alone throw some doubt on the accuracy of the writer.
Moreover, this Chronicle of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Brieuc is a late compilation, and such a circumstantial
account of a matter which, if it really happened, must have been carefully
hushed up at the time, is open to grave suspicion when unconfirmed by any other
testimony. The Angevin accounts of Fulk’s character may fairly be set against it:
they rest on quite as good authority. But the sequel of the story furnishes a yet
stronger argument, for it shows that the murder would have been what most of the
Angevin counts looked upon as much worse than a crime—a great blunder for
Fulk’s own interest.

<p>Just at this crisis the Normans made a raid upon
Britanny, of which their dukes claimed the overlordship.
They captured the bishop of Nantes, and the citizens, thus
left without a leader of any kind, and in hourly fear of being
attacked by the “pirates,” sent an urgent appeal to Fulk for
help. Fulk promised to send them succour, but some delay
occurred; at the end of a week’s waiting the people of
Nantes acted for themselves, and succeeded in putting the
invaders to flight. Indignant at the Angevin count’s failure
to help, they threw off all allegiance to him and chose for
their ruler Hoel, one of the sons of Alan Barbetorte.<a id="Anchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 261.">[261]</a></p>

<p>These clouds on the western horizon did not trouble the
peace of Fulk’s last hour. As he knelt to receive the holy
communion in <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin’s church on one of the feasts of
the patron saint, a slight feeling of illness came over him;
he returned to his place in the choir, and there, in the arms
of his brother-canons, passed quietly away.<a id="Anchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 262.">[262]</a> We cannot
doubt that they laid him to rest in the church he had loved
so well.<a id="Anchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 263.">[263]</a> With him was buried the peace of the Marchland.
Never again was it to have a ruler who “waged no wars”;
never again, till the title of count of Anjou was on the eve
of being merged in loftier appellations, was that title to be
borne by one whose character might give him some claim to
share the epithet of “the Good,” although circumstances
caused him to lead a very different life. Fulk the Second
stands all alone as the ideal Angevin count, and it is in this
point of view that the legends of his life—for we cannot call
them history—have a value of their own. The most famous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
of them all is, in its original shape, a charming bit of pure
Christian poetry. One day—so the tradition ran—the
count, on his way to Tours, was accosted by a leper desiring
to be carried to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin’s. All shrank in horror from the
wretched being except Fulk, who at once took him on his
shoulders and carried him to the church-door. There his
burthen suddenly vanished; and at the midnight service, as
the count-canon sat in his stall, he beheld in a trance <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Martin, who told him that in his charity he had, like another
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Christopher, unwittingly carried the Lord Himself.<a id="Anchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 264.">[264]</a> Later
generations added a sequel to the story. Fulk, they said,
after his return to Angers, was further rewarded by a second
vision; an angel came to him and foretold that his successors
to the ninth generation should extend their power even to
the ends of the earth.<a id="Anchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 265.">[265]</a> At the time when this prophecy
appears in history, it had already reached its fulfilment. In
all likelihood it was then a recent invention; in the legend
to which it was attached it has obviously no natural place.
But its introduction into the story of Fulk the Good was
prompted by a significant instinct. At the height of their
power and their glory, the reckless, ruthless house of Anjou
still did not scorn to believe that their greatness had been
foretold not to the warrior-founder, not to the bravest of
his descendants, but to the good count who sought after
righteousness and peace. Even they were willing, in theory
at least, to accept the dominion of the earth as the promised
reward not of valour but of charity.</p>

<p>Whatever may be the origin of the prophecy, however,
it was in the reign of Fulk’s son and successor Geoffrey
Greygown that the first steps were taken towards its realization.
Legend has been as busy with the first Geoffrey of
Anjou as with his father; but it is legend of a very different
kind. The epic bards of the marchland singled out Geoffrey
for their special favourite; in their hands he became the
hero of marvellous combats, of impossible deeds of knightly
prowess and strategical skill, of marvellous stories utterly
unhistoric in form, but significant as indications of the character<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
popularly attributed to him—a character quite borne
out by those parts of his career which are attested by
authentic history. Whatever share of Fulk’s more refined
tastes may have been inherited by either of his sons seems
to have fallen to the second, Guy, who early passed into the
quiet life of the monk in the abbey of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Paul at Corméri in
Touraine.<a id="Anchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 266.">[266]</a> The elder was little more than a rough, dashing
soldier, whose careless temper shewed itself in his very dress.
Clad in the coarse grey woollen tunic of the Angevin
peasantry,<a id="Anchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 267.">[267]</a> Geoffrey Greygown made himself alike by his
simple attire and by his daring valour a conspicuous figure
in the courts and camps of King Lothar and Duke Hugh.</p>

<p>The receiver of Fulk’s famous letter had gone before him
to the grave; Louis From-over-sea, the grandson of Eadward
the Elder, the last Karolingian worthy of his race, had died
in 954. His death brought the house of France a step
nearer to the throne; but it was still only one step. Lothar,
the son of Louis, was crowned in his father’s stead; two
years later the king-maker followed the king; and thenceforth
his son, the new duke of the French, Hugh Capet,
steadily prepared to exchange his ducal cap for a crown
which nevertheless he was too prudent to seize before the
time. In the face of countless difficulties, Louis in his
eighteen years’ reign had contrived to restore the monarchy
of Laon to a very real kingship. His greatest support in
this task had been his wife’s brother, the Emperor Otto the
Great. The two brothers-in-law, who had come to their
thrones in the same year, were fast friends in life and death;
and Otto remained the faithful guardian of his widowed
sister and her son. So long as he lived, Hugh’s best policy
was peace; and while Hugh remained quiet, there was little
scope for military or political action on the part of his
adherent Geoffrey of Anjou. In 973, however, the great
Emperor died; and soon after he was gone the alliance
between the Eastern and Western Franks began to shew
signs of breaking. Lothar and Otto <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> were brothers-in-law<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
as well as cousins, but they were not friends as their
fathers had been. In an evil hour Lothar was seized with a
wild longing to regain the land which bore his name,—that
fragment of the old “Middle Kingdom,” known as the duchy
of Lotharingia or Lorraine, which after long fluctuating
between its attachment to the imperial crown and its loyalty
to the Karolingian house had finally cast in its lot with the
Empire, with the full assent of Louis From-over-sea. Lothar
brooded over its loss till in 978, when Otto and his queen
were holding their court at Aachen, his jealousy could no
longer endure the sight of his rival so near the border, and
he summoned the nobles of his realm to an expedition into
Lorraine.<a id="Anchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 268.">[268]</a> Nothing could better fall in with the plans of
Hugh Capet than a breach between Lothar and Otto; the
call to arms was readily answered by the duke and his
followers, and the grey tunic of the Angevin count was conspicuous
at the muster.<a id="Anchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 269.">[269]</a> The suddenness of Lothar’s march
compelled Otto to make a hasty retreat from Aachen; but
all that the West-Franks gained was a mass of plunder, and
the vain glory of turning the great bronze eagle on the
palace of Charles the Great towards the east instead of the
west.<a id="Anchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 270.">[270]</a> While they were plundering Aachen Otto was preparing
a counter-invasion.<a id="Anchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 271.">[271]</a> Bursting upon the western
realm, he drove the king to cross the Seine and seek help of
the duke, and before Hugh could gather troops enough to
stop him he had made his way to the gates of Paris. For
a while the French and the Germans lay encamped on
opposite banks of the river, the duke waiting till his troops
came up, and beguiling the time with skirmishes and trials
of individual valour.<a id="Anchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 272.">[272]</a> But as soon as Otto perceived that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
his adversaries were becoming dangerous he struck his tents
and marched rapidly homewards, satisfied with having inflicted
on his rash cousin a far greater alarm and more
serious damage than he had himself suffered from Lothar’s
wild raid.<a id="Anchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 273.">[273]</a></p>

<p>From that time forth, at least, Geoffrey Greygown’s life
was a busy and a stirring one. It seems to have been in
the year of the Lotharingian raid that he married his second
wife, Adela, countess in her own right of Chalon-sur-Saône,
and now the widow of Count Lambert of Autun.<a id="Anchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 274.">[274]</a> By his
first marriage, with another Adela, he seems to have had
only a daughter, Hermengard, who had been married as
early as 970<a id="Anchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 275.">[275]</a> to Conan the Crooked, count of Rennes.
There can be little doubt that this marriage was a stroke of
policy on Geoffrey’s part, intended to pave the way for
Angevin intervention in the affairs of Britanny. The claims
of Fulk the Good to the overlordship of Nantes had of
course expired with him; whatever rights the widow of
Duke Alan might carry to her second husband, they could
not pass to her stepson. Still Geoffrey could hardly fail to
cherish designs upon, at least, the debateable ground which
lay between the Mayenne and the original county of Nantes.
Meanwhile the house of Rennes had managed to establish,
by the right of the stronger, its claim to the dukedom of
Britanny. Hoel, a son of Alan Barbetorte, remained count
of Nantes for nearly twenty years after Fulk’s death;
his career was ended at last by the hand of an assassin;<a id="Anchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 276.">[276]</a>
and as his only child was an infant, his brother Guerech,
already bishop of Nantes, was called upon to succeed him,
as the only surviving descendant of Alan who was capable
of defending the state. Guerech was far better fitted for a
secular than for an ecclesiastical ruler; as bishop, his chief
care was to restore or rebuild his cathedral, and for this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
object he was so eager in collecting contributions that he
made a journey to the court of Lothar to ask help of the
king in person. His way home lay directly through Anjou.
Geoffrey felt that his opportunity had come; and he set the
first example of a mode of action which thenceforth became
a settled practice of the Angevin counts. He laid traps in
all directions to catch the unwary traveller, took him captive,
and only let him go after extorting homage not merely for
the debateable land, but also for Nantes itself; in a word,
for all that part of Britanny which had been held or claimed
by Fulk as Drogo’s guardian.<a id="Anchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 277.">[277]</a></p>

<p>Geoffrey had gained his hold over Nantes; but in so
doing he had brought upon himself the wrath of his son-in-law.
Conan, as duke of Britanny, claimed for himself the
overlordship of Nantes, and regarded Guerech’s enforced
homage to Geoffrey as an infringement of his own rights.
His elder sons set out to attack their step-mother’s father,
made a raid upon Anjou, and were only turned back from
the very gates of Angers by a vigorous sally of Geoffrey
himself.<a id="Anchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 278.">[278]</a> Conan next turned his vengeance upon the unlucky
count-bishop of Nantes. The Angevin and his unwilling
vassal made common cause against their common
enemy, who marched against their united forces, bringing
with him a contingent of the old ravagers of Nantes—the
Normans.<a id="Anchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 279.">[279]</a> The rivals met not far from Nantes, on the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lande</i> of Conquereux, one of those soft, boggy heaths so
common in Britanny; and the issue of the fight was
recorded in an Angevin proverb—“Like the battle of Conquereux,
where the crooked overcame the straight.”<a id="Anchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 280.">[280]</a> Conan
was, however, severely wounded, and does not appear to
have followed up his victory; and the Nantes question was
left to be fought out ten years later, on the very same
ground, by Geoffrey’s youthful successor.</p>

<p>The death of Lothar, early in March 986, brought Hugh
Capet within one step of the throne. The king’s last years
had been spent in endeavouring to secure the succession to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
his son by obtaining for him the homage of the princes of
Aquitaine and the support of the duke of the French—two
objects not very easy to combine, for the great duchies north
and south of the Loire were divided by an irreconcileable
antipathy. In 956 William “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Tête-d’Etoupe</span>,” or the “Shockhead,”
strong in his triple power as count of Poitou, count
of Auvergne and duke of Aquitaine—strong, too, in his
alliance with Normandy, for he had married a sister of his
namesake of the Long Sword—had bidden defiance not
unsuccessfully to Lothar and Hugh the Great both at once.<a id="Anchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 281.">[281]</a>
In 961 Lothar granted the county of Poitiers to Hugh;<a id="Anchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 282.">[282]</a>
but all he could give was an empty title; when William
Shockhead died in 963,<a id="Anchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 283.">[283]</a> his son William Fierabras stepped
into his place as count of Poitou, duke of Aquitaine, and

<p>It was now evident that the line of Charles the Great
was about to expire in a worthless boy. While the young
King Louis, as the chroniclers say, “did nothing,”<a id="Anchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 284.">[284]</a> the duke
of the French and his followers were almost openly preparing
for the last step of all. The count of Anjou, following as ever
closely in the wake of his overlord, now ventured on a bold
aggression. Half by force, half by fraud, he had already
carried his power beyond the Mayenne; he now crossed the
Loire and attacked his southern neighbour the count of
Poitou. Marching boldly down the road which led from
Angers to Poitiers, he took Loudun, and was met at Les
Roches by William Fierabras, whom he defeated in a pitched
battle and pursued as far as a place which in the next
generation was marked by the castle of Mirebeau. Of the
subsequent details of the war we know nothing; it ended
however in a compromise; Geoffrey kept the lands which he
had won, but he kept them as the “man” of Duke William.<a id="Anchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 285.">[285]</a>
They seem to have consisted of a series of small fiefs
scattered along the valleys of the little rivers Layon, Argenton,
Thouet and Dive, which furrow the surface of northern<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
Poitou.<a id="Anchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 286.">[286]</a> The most important was Loudun, a little town
some eighteen miles north-west of Poitiers. Even to-day its
gloomy, crooked, rough-paved streets, its curious old houses,
its quaintly-attired people, have a strangely old-world look;
lines within lines of broken wall wind round the hill on
whose slope the town is built, and in their midst stands a
great square keep, the work of Geoffrey’s successors. He
had won a footing in Poitou; they learned to use it for ends
of which, perhaps, he could as yet scarcely dream. Loudun
looked southward to Poitiers, but it looked northward and
eastward too, up the valley of the Thouet which led straight
up to Saumur, the border-fortress of Touraine and Anjou,
and across the valley of the Vienne which led from the Angevin
frontier into the heart of southern Touraine. Precious
as it might be in itself, Loudun was soon to be far more
precious as a point of vantage not so much against the lord
of Poitiers as against the lord of Chinon, Saumur and Tours.</p>

<p>The little marchland had thus openly begun her career
of aggression on the west and on the south. It seems that
a further promise of extension to the northward was now
held by Hugh Capet before the eyes of his faithful Angevin
friend. Geoffrey’s northern neighbour was as little disposed
as the southern to welcome the coming king. The overlordship
of Maine was claimed by the duke of the Normans on
the strength of a grant made to Hrolf in 924 by King
Rudolf; it was claimed by the duke of the French on the
strength of another grant made earlier in the same year by
Charles the Simple to Hugh the Great,<a id="Anchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 287.">[287]</a> as well as in virtue
of the original definition of their duchy “between Seine and
Loire”; but the Cenomannian counts owned no allegiance
save to the heirs of Charles the Great, and firmly refused all
obedience to the house of France. Hugh Capet, now king
in all but name, laid upon the lord of the Angevin march
the task of reducing them to submission. He granted
Maine to Geoffrey Greygown<a id="Anchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 288.">[288]</a>—a merely nominal gift at the
moment, for Hugh (or David) of Maine was in full and independent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
possession of his county; and generation after generation
had to pass away before the remote consequences of
that grant were fully worked out to their wonderful end.
Geoffrey himself had no time to take any steps towards enforcing
his claim. Events came thick and fast in the early
summer of 987. King Louis <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr> was seized at Senlis with
one of those sudden and violent sicknesses so common in
that age, and died on May 22. The last Karolingian king
was laid in his grave at Compiègne; the nobles of the realm
came together in a hurried meeting; on the proposal of the
archbishop of Reims they swore to the duke of the French a
solemn oath that they would take no steps towards choosing
a ruler till a second assembly should be held, for which a
day was fixed.<a id="Anchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 289.">[289]</a> Hugh knew now that he had only a few days
more to wait. He spent the interval in besieging a certain
Odo, called “Rufinus”—in all likelihood a rebellious vassal—who
was holding out against him at Marson in Champagne;
and with him went his constant adherent Geoffrey
of Anjou. At the end of the month the appointed assembly
was held at Senlis. Passing over the claims of Charles of
Lorraine, the only surviving descendant of the great Emperor,
the nobles with one consent offered the crown to the
duke of the French. From his camp before Marson Hugh
went to receive, at Noyon on the 1st of June,<a id="Anchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 290.">[290]</a> the crown for
which he had been waiting all his life. Geoffrey, whom he
had left to finish the siege, fell sick and died before the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
place, seven weeks after his patron’s coronation;<a id="Anchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 291.">[291]</a> and his
body was carried back from distant Champagne to be laid
by his father’s side in the church of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin at Tours.<a id="Anchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 292.">[292]</a></p>

<p>The century of preparation and transition was over; the
great change was accomplished, not to be undone again for
eight hundred years. The first period of strictly French
history and the first period of Angevin history close together.
The rulers of the marchland had begun to shew that they
were not to be confined within the limits which nature itself
might seem to have fixed for them; they had stretched a
hand beyond their two river-boundaries, and they had begun
to cast their eyes northward and dream of a claim which
was to have yet more momentous results. In the last years
of Geoffrey Greygown we trace a foreshadowing of the
wonderful career which his successor is to begin. From the
shadow we pass to its realization; with the new king and the
new count we enter upon a new era.</p>

<span class="note_title">ON THE SOURCES AND AUTHENTICITY OF EARLY ANGEVIN HISTORY.</span></h4>

<p>Our only detailed account of the early Angevins, down to
Geoffrey Greygown, is contained in two books: the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta Consulum
Andegavensium</i></cite>,
by John, monk of Marmoutier, and the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Historia
Comitum Andegavensium</i></cite>,
which goes under the name of Thomas
Pactius, prior of Loches. Both these works were written in the
latter part of the twelfth century; and they may be practically
regarded as one, for the latter is in reality only an abridgement
of the former, with a few slight variations. The
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta Consulum</i></cite>
is
avowedly a piece of patchwork. The author in his “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Proœmium</span>”
tells us that it is founded on the work of a certain Abbot Odo which
had been recast by Thomas Pactius, prior of Loches, and to which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
he himself, John of Marmoutier, had made further additions from
sundry other sources which he enumerates
    (<cite>Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes
d’Anjou</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 353</cite>.
This “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Proœmium</span>” is there printed at the head
of the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Historia Abbreviata</i></cite>
instead of the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta Consulum</i></cite>,
to which,
however, it really belongs; see
    <cite><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Mabille</span>’s introduction, <i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr>
<abbr title="31">xxxi.</abbr></cite>). The
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Historia Comitum Andegavensium</i></cite>
    (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 320</cite>) bears
the name of Thomas of Loches, and thus professes to be the earlier
version on which John worked. But it is now known that the
work of Thomas, which still exists in <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr>, is totally distinct from
that published under his name (see
    <cite><abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Mabille’s introduction to
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes d’Anjou</i>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <abbr title="18, 19">xviii., xix.</abbr></cite>), and, moreover, that the printed
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Historia Comitum</i></cite>
is really a copy of a series of extracts from Ralf
de Diceto’s
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Abbreviationes Chronicorum</i></cite>—extracts which Ralf himself
had taken from the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta Consulum</i></cite>
(see
    <cite>Bishop Stubbs’ preface
to <abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Ralf de Diceto">R. Diceto</abbr>, <abbr title="volume 2">vol. ii.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <abbr title="23–29">xxiii.–xxix</abbr></cite>).
There is, however, one other
source of information about the early Angevins which, if its author
was really what he professed to be, is of somewhat earlier date and
far higher value, although of very small extent. This is the fragment
of the
    <cite><i>Angevin History</i></cite>
which goes under the name of Count
Fulk Rechin. Its authorship has been questioned, but it has never
been disproved; and one thing at least is certain—the writer, whoever
he may have been, had some notion of historical and chronological
possibilities, whereas John of Marmoutier had none. Fulk
Rechin (as we must for the present call him, without stopping to
decide whether he has a right to the name) gives a negative
testimony against all John’s stories about the earlier members of the
Angevin house. He pointedly states that he knows nothing about
the first three counts (Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 376), and he makes
no mention of anybody before Ingelger. Now, supposing he really
was Count Fulk <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr> of Anjou, it is fairly safe to assume that if
anything had been known about his own forefathers he would
have been more likely to know it than a monk who wrote nearly a
hundred years later. On the other hand, if he was a twelfth-century
forger, such a daring avowal of ignorance, put into the mouth of
such a personage, shews the writer’s disregard of the tales told
by the monk, and can only have been intended to give them the
lie direct.</p>

<p>The two first members of the Angevin house, then—Tortulf
of Rennes and his son Tertullus—rest solely on the evidence of
these two late writers. Their accounts are not recommended by
intrinsic probability. We are roused to suspicion by the very first
sentence of the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta Consulum</i></cite><span class="nobreak">:—</span>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fuit vir quidam de Armoricâ
Galliâ, nomine Torquatius. Iste a Britonibus, proprietatem vetusti
ac Romani nominis ignorantibus, corrupto vocabulo Tortulfus dictus
fuit</span>” (Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 35). When one finds that his son is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
called Tertullus, it is impossible not to suspect that “Torquatius”
and “Tertullus” are only two different attempts to Latinize a
genuine Teutonic “Tortulf.” For the lives of these personages
John of Marmoutier gives no distinct dates; but he tells us that
Torquatius was made Forester of Nid-de-Merle by Charles the Bald,
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">eo anno quo ab Andegavis et a toto suo regno Normannos expulit</span>”
    (<cite>Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 35</cite>). Now this is rather vague, but
it looks as if the date intended were 873. We are next told that
Tertullus went to seek his fortune in France <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">“circa id temporis quo
Karolus Calvus <span class="dots">...</span> ex triarcho monarchus factus, non longo regnavit
spatio</span>”
    (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 36, 37</cite>), whatever that may mean. The next
chronological landmark is that of the “reversion” of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin,
which John copies from the Cluny treatise
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Reversione <abbr title="Beati">B.</abbr> Martini</i></cite>,
and copies wrong. Then comes Fulk the Red, on whom he says
the whole county of Anjou was conferred by Duke Hugh of Burgundy,
guardian of Charles the Simple, the county having until then
been divided in two parts; and he also says that Fulk was related
to Hugh through his grandmother
    (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 64, 65</cite>).</p>

<p>There are several unmanageable points in this story. 1. The
pedigree cannot be right. It is clear that John took Hugh the
Great (“Hugh of Burgundy,” as he calls him) to be a son of the
earlier Hugh of Burgundy (one copy of the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta</i></cite>,
that printed by
D’Achéry in his
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Spicilegium</i>, <abbr title="volume 3">vol. iii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 243</cite>,
actually adds “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">filius
alterius Hugonis</span>”), and this latter to have been the father of
Petronilla, wife of Tertullus.</p>

<p>The chronology of the life of Fulk the Red, long a matter of
mingled tradition and guess-work, has now been fairly established by
the investigations of <abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> <abbr title="Émile">E.</abbr> Mabille. This gentleman has examined
the subject in his introduction to <abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Messieurs">MM.</abbr> Marchegay and Salmon’s
edition of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chroniques des Comtes d’Anjou</i>, and in an article entitled
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Invasions normandes dans la Loire</span>,” in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bibliothèque de
l’Ecole des Chartes</i>, series <abbr title="6">vi.</abbr> <abbr title="volume 5">vol. v.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 149–194; to each of these
works is appended by way of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pièces justificatives</i> a series of
charters of the highest importance for establishing the facts of the
early history of Anjou and Touraine. The first appearance of Fulk
is as witness to a charter given at Tours by Odo, as abbot of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Martin’s, in April 886.
    (<cite>Mabille, <abbr title="introduction">introd.</abbr> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <abbr title="69">lxix.</abbr> note</cite>). Now
if Fulk the Red was old enough to be signing charters in 886,
his parents must have been married long before the days of Louis
the Stammerer—in 870 at the very latest, and more likely several
years earlier still. His grandparents therefore (<i>i.e.</i> Tertullus and
Petronilla) must have been married before 850. It is possible that
Hugh the Abbot who died in 887 may have had a daughter married
as early as this; but it does not seem very likely.</p>

<p>2. The story of Ingelger’s investiture with Orleans and the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129">129</a></span>
Gâtinais is suspicious. His championship of the slandered countess
of Gâtinais
    (<cite>Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 40–45</cite>) is one of those ubiquitous
tales which are past confuting. Still the statement that he somehow
acquired lands in the Gâtinais is in itself not impossible. But the
coupling together of Gâtinais and Orléans is very suspicious. Not
one of the historical descendants of Ingelger had, as far as is known,
anything to do with either place for nearly two hundred years. There
is documentary proof (see the signatures to a charter printed in
    <cite>Mabille’s <abbr title="introduction">introd.</abbr> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <abbr title="64">lxiv</abbr>, note 1</cite>;
the reference there given to
Salmon is wrong) that in 942, the year after the death of Fulk the
Red, the viscount of Orléans was one Geoffrey; and he belonged
to a totally different family—but a family which, it seems, did in
time acquire the county of Gâtinais, and in the end became merged
in the house of Anjou, when the son of Geoffrey of Gâtinais and
Hermengard of Anjou succeeded his uncle Geoffrey Martel in 1061.
It is impossible not to suspect that the late Angevin writers took up
this story at the wrong end and moved it back two hundred years.</p>

<p>3. Comes the great question of Ingelger’s investiture with half
the county of Anjou.</p>

<p>In not one of the known documents of the period does Ingelger’s
name appear. The only persons who do appear as rulers of the
Angevin march are Hugh the Abbot and his successor Odo, till we
get to Fulk the Viscount. Fulk’s first appearance in this capacity
is in September 898, when “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fulco vicecomes</span>” signs a charter of
Ardradus, brother of Atto, viscount of Tours
    (<cite>Mabille, <abbr title="Introduction">Introd.</abbr> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <abbr title="93">xciii</abbr></cite>). He witnesses, by the same title, several charters of Robert
the Abbot-Count during the next two years. In July 905 we have
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">signum Fulconis Turonorum et Andecavorum vicecomitis</span>” (<i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr>
<abbr title="95">xcv</abbr>); in October 909 “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">signum domni Fulconis Andecavorum
comitis</span>” (<i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <abbr title="98">xcviii</abbr>); and in October 912 he again signs among
the counts (<i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <abbr title="61">lxi</abbr>, note 4). But in May 914, and again as late
as August 924, he resumes the title of viscount (<i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <abbr title="100">c</abbr> and <abbr title="62">lxii</abbr>,
note 2). Five years later, in the seventh year of King Rudolf, we
find a charter granted by Fulk himself, “count of the Angevins and
abbot of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Aubin and <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Licinius” (<i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <abbr title="101">ci</abbr>); and thenceforth this
is his established title.</p>

<p>These dates at once dispose of <abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Ralf de Diceto">R. Diceto</abbr>’s statement (Stubbs,
<abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 143) that Fulk succeeded his father Ingelger as second
count in 912. They leave us in doubt as to the real date of his
appointment as count; but whether we adopt the earlier date, in or
before 909, or the later one, between 924 and 929, as that of his
definite investiture, we cannot accept the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta’s</i></cite>
story that it was
granted by Hugh the Great on behalf of Charles the Simple. For
in 909 the duke of the French was not Hugh, but his father Robert;
and in 924–929 the king was not Charles, but Rudolf of Burgundy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p>But the chronology is not the only difficulty in the tale of Count
Ingelger. The
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta</i></cite>-writers admit that “another count” (<i>i.e.</i> the
former count, Duke Hugh) went on ruling beyond the Mayenne.
This at once raises a question, very important yet very simple—Did
the Angevin March, the March of Robert the Brave and his
successors, extend on both sides of the Mayenne? For the
assumption that it did is the ground of the whole argument for the
“bipartite” county.</p>

<p>The old territory of the Andes certainly spread on both sides of
the river. So also, it seems, did the march of Count Lambert. The
commission of a lord marcher is of necessity indefinite; it implies
holding the border-land and extending it into the enemy’s country if
possible. It appears to me that when Lambert turned traitor he
carried out this principle from the other side; when Nantes became
Breton, the whole land up to the Mayenne became Breton too.
This view is distinctly supported by a charter in which Herispoë, in
August 852, styles himself ruler of Britanny and up to the river
Mayenne
    (<cite>Lobineau, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Histoire">Hist.</abbr> Bretagne</i>, <abbr title="volume 2">vol. ii.</abbr> <abbr title="column">col.</abbr> 55</cite>); and it gives the
most rational explanation of the Breton wars of Fulk the Good,
Geoffrey Greygown and Fulk Nerra, which ended in Anjou’s recovery
of the debateable ground. If it is correct, there is an end at
once of the “bipartite county” and of Count Ingelger; “the other
count” cannot have ruled west of the Mayenne, therefore he must
have ruled east of it, and there is no room for any one else.</p>

<p>The one writer whose testimony seems to lend some countenance
to that of the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta</i></cite>
need not trouble us much. Fulk Rechin
    (<cite>Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 374</cite>) does call Ingelger the first count; but
his own confession that he knew nothing about his first five ancestors
beyond their names gives us a right to think, in the absence of
confirmatory evidence, that he may have been mistaken in using the
title. He says nothing about the county having ever been bipartite,
and his statement that his forefathers received their honours from
Charles the Bald, not from the house of Paris (<i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 376), may be
due to the same misconception, strengthened by a desire, which in
Fulk Rechin would be extremely natural, to disclaim all connexion
with the “genus impii Philippi,” or even by an indistinct idea of the
investiture of Fulk <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> For, if this is regarded as having taken place
between 905 and 909, it must fall in the reign of Charles the
Simple, and might be technically ascribed to him, though there can
be no doubt that it was really owing to the duke of the French.
Every step of Fulk’s life, as we can trace it in the charters, shows
him following closely in the wake of Odo, Robert and Hugh; and
the dependance of Anjou on the duchy of France is distinctly
acknowledged by his grandson.</p>

<p>The latter part of the account of Ingelger in the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta</i><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
(Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 47–62)</cite>
is copied bodily from the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tractatus
de reversione <abbr title="Beati">B.</abbr> Martini a Burgundiâ</i>, which professes to have been
written by <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Odo of Cluny at the request of his foster-brother,
Count Fulk the Good. The wild anachronisms of this treatise have
been thoroughly exposed by its latest editor, <abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> <abbr title="André">A.</abbr> Salmon
    (<cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Supplément
au Recueil des Chroniques de Touraine</i>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <abbr title="11–28">xi–xxviii</abbr></cite>), and
<abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Mabille
    (<cite>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Invasions normandes dans la Loire et les pérégrinations
du corps de <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin</span>,” in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Bibliothèque">Bibl.</abbr> de l’Ecole des Chartes</i>,
<abbr title="series 6">ser. vi.</abbr> <abbr title="volume 5">vol. v.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 149–194</cite>). It is certain, from the statement of
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Odo’s own biographer John, that the saint was born in 879 and
entered religion in 898; at which time it is evident that Fulk the
Good, the Red Count’s youngest son, must have been quite a child,
if even he was in existence at all. The letters in which he and the
abbot address each other as foster-brothers are therefore forgeries;
and the treatise which these letters introduce is no better. The
only part of it which directly concerns our present subject is the end,
recounting how the body of the Apostle of the Gauls, after a thirty
years’ exile at Auxerre, whither it had been carried to keep it safe
from the sacrilegious hands of Hrolf and his northmen when they
were ravaging Touraine, was brought back in triumph to its home at
Tours on December 13, 887, by Ingelger, count of Gâtinais and
Anjou, and grandson of Hugh, duke of Burgundy. Now there is no
doubt at all that the relics of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin were carried into Burgundy
and afterwards brought back again, and that the feast of the Reversion
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin on December 13 was regularly celebrated at Tours
in commemoration of the event; but the whole history of the adventures
of the relics as given in this treatise is manifestly wrong in its
details; <i>e.g.</i> the statements about Hrolf are ludicrous—the “reversion”
is said to have taken place after his conversion. <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr> Salmon
has gone carefully through the whole story: <abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Mabille has sifted
it still more thoroughly. These two writers have shewn that the
body of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin really went through a great many more “peregrinations”
than those recounted in the Cluny treatise, that the
real date of the reversion is 885, and in short that the treatise is
wrong in every one of its dates and every one of the names of the
bishops whom it mentions as concerned in the reversion, save those of
Archbishop Adaland of Tours and his brother Raino, who, however,
was bishop of Angers, not of Orléans as the treatise says. The passages
in the Tours chronicle where Ingelger is described as count of
Anjou are all derived from this source, and therefore prove nothing,
except the writer’s ignorance about counts and bishops alike.</p>

<p>The mention of Archbishop Adaland brings us to another subject—Ingelger’s
marriage. Ralf de Diceto (Stubbs, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 139)
says that he married Ælendis, niece of Archbishop Adaland and of
Raino, bishop of Angers, and that these two prelates gave to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
young couple their own hereditary estates at Amboise, in Touraine and
in the Orléanais. The
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta Consulum</i> (Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 45)</cite>
say the same, but afterwards make Raino bishop of Orléans. This
story seems to be a bit of truth which has found its way into a mass
of fiction; at any rate it is neither impossible nor improbable. The
author of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Reversione</i> is quite right in saying that Archbishop
Adaland died shortly after the return of the relics; his statement,
and those of the Tours Chronicle, that Adaland was consecrated in
870 and died in 887, are borne out by the same charters which
enable us to track the career of Fulk the Red. As to Raino—there
was a Raino ordained bishop of Angers in 881
    (<cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicon Vindocinense">Chron. Vindoc.</abbr> ad
<abbr title="annum">ann.</abbr> in Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglises d’Anjou</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 160</cite>). The version which
makes Orléans his see is derived from the false Cluny treatise.</p>

<p>Fulk the Red was witnessing charters in 886 and died in 941 or
942. He must have been born somewhere between 865 and 870;
as the traditional writers say he died “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">senex et plenus dierum, in
bonâ senectute</span>,” it may have been nearer the earlier date. There is
thus no chronological reason why these two prelates should not have
been his mother’s uncles; and as the house of Anjou certainly
acquired Amboise somehow, it may just as well have been in this
way as in any other.</p>

<span class="note_title">THE PALACE OF THE COUNTS AT ANGERS.</span></h4>

<p>Not only ordinary English tourists, but English historical
scholars have been led astray in the topography of early Angers by
an obstinate local tradition which long persisted in asserting that the
counts and the bishops of Angers had at some time or other made
an exchange of dwellings; that the old ruined hall within the castle
enclosure was a piece of Roman work, and had served, before this
exchange, as the synodal hall of the bishops. The date adopted
for this exchange, when I visited Angers in 1877 (I have no knowledge
of the place since that time) was “the ninth century”; some
years before it was the twelfth or thirteenth century, and the synodal
hall of the present bishop’s palace, with its undercroft, was shown
and accepted as the home of all the Angevin counts down to Geoffrey
Plantagenet at least. The whole history of the two palaces—that of
the counts and that of the bishops—has, however, been cleared up
by two local archæologists, <abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> de Beauregard
    (<cite>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Palais épiscopal
et l’Eglise cathédrale d’Angers</span>,” in <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue de l’Anjou et de Maine-et-Loire</i>,
1855, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 246–256</cite>), and <abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> d’Espinay, president of the
Archæological Commission of Maine-et-Loire <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
    (<cite>“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Palais des Comtes
d’Anjou</span>,” <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue historique de l’Anjou</i>, 1872, <abbr title="volume 8">vol. viii.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 153–170</cite>;

their arguments may be briefly summed up. The first bit of evidence
on the subject is a charter
    (<cite>printed by <abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> de Beauregard,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" >Revue de l’Anjou et de Maine-et-Loire</i>, as above, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 248, 249</cite>;
also in
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gallia Christiana</i>, <abbr title="volume 14">vol. xiv.</abbr> <abbr title="instruments">instr.</abbr> <abbr title="columns">cols.</abbr> 145, 146) of Charles
the Bald, dated July 2, 851</cite>,
and ratifying an exchange of lands
between “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dodo venerabilis Andegavorum Episcopus et Odo illustris
comes</span>.” The exchange is thus described<span class="nobreak">:—</span>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Dedit itaque præfatus
Dodo episcopus antedicto Odoni comiti, ex rebus matris ecclesiæ
<abbr title="Sancti">S.</abbr> Mauricii, æquis mensuris funibusque determinatam paginam terræ
juxta murum civitatis Andegavensis, in quâ opportunitas jam dicti
comitis mansuræ sedis suorumque successorum esse cognoscitur.
Et, e contra, in compensatione hujus rei, dedit idem Odo comes ex
comitatu suo terram <abbr title="Sancto">S.</abbr> Mauricio æquis mensuris similiter funibus
determinatam prænominato Dodoni episcopo successoribusque suis
habendam in quâ predecessorum suorum comitum sedes fuisse
memoratur.</span>” As <abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> de Beauregard points out, the traditionary
version—whether placing the exchange in the ninth century or in the
twelfth—is based on a misunderstanding of this charter. The
charter says not a word of the bishop giving up his own actual
abode to the count; it says he gave a plot of ground near the city
wall, and suitable for the count to build himself a house upon.
Moreover the words “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">sedes fuisse memoratur</span>” seem to imply that
what the count gave was not his own present dwelling either, but
only that which had been occupied by his predecessors. There can
be little doubt that the Merovingian counts dwelt on the site of the
Roman citadel of Juliomagus; and this was unquestionably where
the bishop’s palace now stands. That it already stood there in the
closing years of the eleventh century is proved by a charter, quoted
by <abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> d’Espinay (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue historique de l’Anjou</i>, <abbr title="volume 8">vol. viii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 200, note 2)
from the cartulary of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Aubin’s Abbey, giving an account of a
meeting held “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">in domibus episcopalibus <em>juxta <abbr title="Sanctum">S.</abbr> Mauricium
Andegavorum matrem ecclesiam</em></span>,” in <span class="allcap">A.D.</span> 1098.</p>

<p>So much for the position of the bishop’s dwelling from 851
downwards. Of the position of the count’s palace—the abode of
Odo and his successors, built on the piece of land near the city
wall—the first indication is in an account of a great fire at Angers
in 1132: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Flante Aquilone, accensus est in mediâ civitate ignis,
videlicet apud <abbr title="Sanctum">S.</abbr> Anianum; et tanto incendio grassatus est ut ecclesiam
<abbr title="Sancti">S.</abbr> Laudi et omnes officinas, deinde comitis aulam et omnes
cameras miserabiliter combureret et in cinerem redigeret. Sicque
per Aquariam descendens</span>,” etc.
    (<cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicon Sancti Sergii">Chron. S. Serg.</abbr> <abbr title="year">a.</abbr> 1132, Marchegay,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglises</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 144</cite>). The church of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Laud was the old chapel of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Geneviève,—<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">capella <abbr title="Beatae">B.</abbr> Genovefæ virginis, infra muros civitatis
Andegavæ, ante forum videlicet comitalis aulæ posita</span>,” as it is described
in a charter of Geoffrey Martel
    (<cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue <abbr title="Historique">Hist.</abbr> de l’Anjou</i>, 1872,
<abbr title="volume 8">vol. viii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 161</cite>)—the exact position of a ruined chapel which was
still visible, some twenty years ago, within the castle enclosure, not far
from the hall which still remains. A fire beginning in the middle
of the city and carried by a north-east wind down to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Laud and
the Evière would not touch the present bishop’s palace, but could
not fail to pass over the site of the castle. The last witness is Ralf
de Diceto
    (<cite>Stubbs, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 291, 292</cite>), who distinctly places the
palace of the counts in his own day—the day of Count Henry Fitz-Empress—in
the south-west corner of the city, with the river at its
feet and the vine-clad hills at its back; and his description of the
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">thalami noviter constructi</span>” just fits in with the account of the fire,
the destruction thereby wrought having doubtless been followed by
a rebuilding on a more regal scale. It seems impossible to doubt
the conclusion of these Angevin archæologists, that the dwelling of
the bishops and the palace of the counts have occupied their present
sites ever since the ninth century. In that case the present synodal
hall, an undoubted work of the early twelfth century, must have been
originally built for none other than its present use; and to a student
of the history of the Angevin counts and kings the most precious
relic in all Angers is the ruined hall looking out upon the Mayenne
from over the castle ramparts. <abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> d’Espinay denies its Roman
origin; he considers it to be a work of the tenth century or beginning
of the eleventh—the one fragment, in fact, of the dwelling-place of
Geoffrey Greygown and Fulk the Black which has survived, not only
the fire of 1132, but also the later destruction in which the apartments
built by Henry have perished.</p>

<span class="note_title">THE MARRIAGES OF GEOFFREY GREYGOWN.</span></h4>

<p>The marriages of Geoffrey Greygown form a subject at once of
some importance and of considerable difficulty. It seems plain that
Geoffrey was twice married, that both his wives bore the same
name, Adela or Adelaide, and that the second was in her own right
countess of Chalon-sur-Saône, and widow of Lambert, count of
Autun. There is no doubt about this second marriage, for we have
documentary evidence that a certain Count Maurice (about whom
the Angevin writers make great blunders, and of whom we shall hear
more later on) was brother at once to Hugh of Chalon, son of Lambert
and Adela, and to Fulk, son of Geoffrey Greygown, and must
therefore have been a son of Geoffrey and Adela. A charter, dated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
between 992 and 998 (see
    <cite>Mabille, <abbr title="Introduction">Introd.</abbr> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="pages 70–71">pp. lxx–lxxi</abbr></cite>),
wherein Hugh, count of Chalon, describes himself as “son of
Adelaide and Lambert who was count of Chalon in right of his
wife,” is approved by “Adelaide his mother and Maurice his brother.”
Now as <abbr title="Rudolf">R.</abbr> Glaber
    (<cite><abbr title="book 3">l. iii.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 2; <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Rerum Gallicarum Scriptores">Rer. Gall. Scriptt.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 10">vol. x.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 27</cite>)
declares that Hugh had no brother, Maurice must have been his
half-brother, <i>i.e.</i> son of his mother and her second husband; and
that that second husband was Geoffrey Greygown appears by several
charters in which Maurice is named as brother of Fulk Nerra.</p>

<p>It is by no means clear who this Adela or Adelaide of Chalon
was. Perry
    (<cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Histoire">Hist.</abbr> de Chalon-sur-Saône</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 86</cite>) and Arbois de Jubainville
(<cite id="note_2c_a"><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes de Champagne</i>, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 140</cite>) say she was daughter of
Robert of Vermandois, count of Troyes, and Vera, daughter of
Gilbert of Burgundy and heiress of Chalon, which at her death passed
to Adela as her only child. But the only authority for this Vera,
Odorannus the monk of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Peter of Sens, says she was married in
956, and Lambert called himself count of Chalon in 960 (Perry,
    <cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Histoire">Hist.</abbr> Chalon, preuves</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 35</cite>.
See also
    <cite>Arbois de Jubainville as
above)</cite>,
so that if he married Vera’s daughter he must have married
a child only three years old. And to add to the confusion, Robert
of Troyes’s wife in 959 signs a charter by the name of “Adelais”
    (<cite>Duchesne, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maison de Vergy, preuves</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 36</cite>). What concerns us
most, however, is not Adela’s parentage, but the date of her marriage
with Geoffrey Greygown; or, which comes to much the same thing,
the date of her first husband’s death. The
    <cite>cartulary of Paray-le-Monial
(Lambert’s foundation)</cite>
gives the date of his death as
February 22, 988. If that were correct, Geoffrey, who died in July
987, could not have married Adela at all, unless she was divorced
and remarried during Lambert’s life. This idea is excluded by a
charter of her grandson Theobald, which distinctly says that
Geoffrey married her after Lambert’s death
    (<cite>Perry, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Histoire">Hist.</abbr> Chalon,
preuves</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 39</cite>); therefore the
    <cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Art de vérifier les Dates</i> (<abbr title="volume 11">vol.
xi.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 129)</cite>
proposes to omit an x and read 978. Adela and
Geoffrey, then, cannot have married earlier than the end of 978.
Geoffrey, however, must have been married long before this, if his
daughter Hermengard was married in 970 to Conan of Britanny
    (<cite>Morice, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Histoire de Bretagne">Hist. Bret.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 63</cite>.
His authority seems to be a
passage in the
    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronico Sancti Michaelis">Chron. S. Michael.</abbr> <abbr title="year">a.</abbr> 970, printed in Labbe’s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bibliotheca">Bibl.</abbr>
Nova <abbr title="Manuscriptorum">MSS.</abbr> Librorum</i>, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 350</cite>,
where, however, the bride is
absurdly made a daughter of Fulk Nerra instead of Geoffrey Greygown).
And in
    <cite>Duchesne’s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Maison de Vergy, preuves</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 39</cite>,
is the
will, dated March 6, 974, of a Countess Adela, wife of a Count
Geoffrey, whereby she bequeathes some lands to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Aubin’s Abbey
at Angers; and as the
    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicæ Sancti Albini">Chron. S. Albin.</abbr> <abbr title="year">a.</abbr> 974 (Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglises</i>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 20)</cite>
also mentions these donations, there can be little doubt that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
she was the wife of Geoffrey of Anjou. <abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Mabille (<cite id="note_2c-a"><abbr title="Introduction">Introd.</abbr> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr>
<abbr title="70">lxx</abbr></cite>) asserts that this Adela, Geoffrey Greygown’s first wife, was Adela
of Vermandois, sister of Robert of Troyes, and appeals to the will
above referred to in proof of his assertion; the will, however, says
nothing of the sort. He also makes the second Adela sister-in-law
instead of daughter to Robert
    (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <abbr title="71">lxxi</abbr></cite>). It seems indeed hopeless
to decide on the parentage of either of these ladies; that of their
children is, however, the only question really important for us.
Hermengard, married in 970 to the duke of Britanny, was clearly
a child of Geoffrey’s first wife; Maurice was as clearly a child
of the second; but whose child was Fulk the Black? Not only
is it a matter of some interest to know who was the mother of the
greatest of the Angevins, but it is a question on whose solution
may depend the solution of another difficulty<span class="nobreak">:—</span>the supposed, but
as yet unascertained, kindred between Fulk’s son Geoffrey Martel
and his wife Agnes of Burgundy. If Fulk was the son of Geoffrey
Greygown and Adela of Chalon, the whole pedigree is clear, and
stands thus:</p>

<p class="noindent">The two last would thus be cousins in the third degree of kindred
according to the canon law. The only apparent difficulty of this
theory is that it makes Fulk so very young. The first child of Adela
of Chalon and Geoffrey cannot have been born earlier than 979,
even if Adela remarried before her first year of widowhood was out;
and we find Fulk Nerra heading his troops in 992, if not before.
But the thing is not impossible. Such precocity would not be
much greater than that of Richard the Fearless, or of Fulk’s own
rival Odo of Blois; and such a wonderful man as Fulk the Black may
well have been a wonderful boy.</p>

<span class="note_title">THE BRETON AND POITEVIN WARS OF GEOFFREY GREYGOWN.</span></h4>

<p>The acts of Geoffrey Greygown in the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta Consulum</i></cite>
are a
mass of fable. The fight with the Dane Æthelwulf and that with
the Saxon Æthelred are mythical on the face of them, and the
writer’s habitual defiance of chronology is carried to its highest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
point in this chapter. From him we turn to the story of Fulk
Rechin. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ille igitur Gosfridus Grisa Gonella, pater avi mei Fulconis,
cujus probitates enumerare non possumus, excussit Laudunum de

qui venerant Andegavim cum prædatorio exercitu, quorum duces
erant filii Isoani (Conani). Et postea fuit cum duce Hugone in

et corpus illius allatum est Turonum et sepultum in ecclesiâ <abbr title="Beati">B.</abbr>
Martini</span>”
    <cite>(Fulk Rechin, Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 376)</cite>.</p>

<p>Whoever was the author of this account, he clearly knew or
cared nothing about the stories of the monkish writers, but had a
perfectly distinct source of information unknown to them. For their
legends he substitutes two things: a war with the count of Poitou,
and a war with the duke of Britanny. On each of these wars we
get some information from one other authority; the question is how
to make this other authority tally with Fulk.</p>

<p>1. As to the Breton war, which seems to be the earlier in date.</p>

<p>No one but Fulk mentions the raid of Conan’s sons upon Angers;
and <abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Mabille
    (<cite><abbr title="Introduction">Introd.</abbr> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" id="note_2d-a">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page 48">p. xlviii</abbr></cite>) objects to it on the ground
that Conan’s sons were not contemporaries of Geoffrey.</p>

<p>Conan of Rennes was killed in 992 in a battle with Geoffrey’s
son. He had been married in 970 to Geoffrey’s daughter Hermengard
(see above, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <a href="#Page_121" title="Go to page 121">121</a>, <a href="#Page_135" title="Go to page 135">135</a>). Now a daughter of Geoffrey in 970
must have been almost a child, but it by no means follows that her
husband was equally young. On the contrary, he seems to have been
sufficiently grown up to take a part in politics twenty years before
    (<cite>Morice, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Histoire de Bretagne">Hist. Bret.</abbr></i> <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 62</cite>). It is certain that he had several
sons; it is certain that two at least of them were not Hermengard’s;
it is likely that none of them were, except his successor Geoffrey.
Supposing Conan was somewhat over fifty when killed (and he may
have been older still) that would make him about thirty when he
married Hermengard; he might have had sons ten years before
that, and those sons might very easily head an attack upon their
stepmother’s father in 980 or thereabouts. Surely <abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Mabille here
makes a needless stumbling-block of the chronology.</p>

<p>If no other writer confirms Fulk’s story, neither does any contradict
it. But in the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta Consulum</i> (Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 91–93)</cite>
an exactly similar tale is told, only in much more detail and
with this one difference, that Fulk Nerra is substituted for Geoffrey
Greygown, and the raid is made to take place just before that other
battle of Conquereux, in 992, in which Conan perished. The only
question now is, which date is the likeliest, Fulk’s or John’s? in
other words, which of these two writers is the better to be trusted?
Surely there can be no doubt about the choice, and we must conclude<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
that, for once, the monk who credits Greygown with so many
exploits that he never performed has denied him the honour of one
to which he is really entitled.</p>

<p>Fulk Rechin’s account of Geoffrey’s Breton war ends here. The
Breton chroniclers ignore this part of the affair altogether; they
seem to take up the thread of the story where the Angevin drops it.
It is they who tell us of the homage of Guerech, and of the battle
of Conquereux; and their accounts of the latter are somewhat
puzzling.
    <cite>The <abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicon Britannicum">Chron. Britann.</abbr> in Lobineau (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Histoire de Bretagne">Hist. Bret.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 2">vol. ii.</abbr>
<abbr title="column">col.</abbr> 32)</cite>
says: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">982. Primum bellum Britannorum et Andegavorum
in Concruz.</span>” The
    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronico Sancti Michaelis">Chron. S. Michael.</abbr> (Labbe, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Bibliotheca">Bibl.</abbr> Nova</i>, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr>
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 350</cite>;
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Rerum Gallicarum Scriptores">Rer. Gall. Scriptt.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 9">vol. ix.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 98)</cite>
says: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">981. Conanus
Curvus contra Andegavenses in Concurrum optime pugnavit.</span>” But
in the other two Breton chronicles the Angevins do not appear.
The
    <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Chronicon">Chron.</abbr> Namnetense</span> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Rerum Gallicarum Scriptores">Rer. Gall. Scriptt.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 8">vol. viii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 278)</cite>
describes the battle as one between Conan and Guerech; the
    <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Chronicon">Chron.</abbr> Briocense</span> (Morice, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Histoire de Bretagne, preuves">Hist. Bret., preuves</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="column">col.</abbr> 32)</cite>
does
the same, and moreover adds that Conan was severely wounded in
the right arm and fled defeated. This last is the only distinct record
of the issue of the battle; nevertheless there are some little indications
which, taken together, give some ground for thinking its record is
wrong. <abbr title="First">1st</abbr>. There is the negative evidence of the silence of the Angevin
writers about the whole affair; they ignore the first battle of
Conquereux as completely as the Bretons ignore the unsuccessful raid
of Conan’s sons. This looks as if each party chronicled its own
successes, and carefully avoided mentioning those of its adversaries.
<abbr title="Second">2d</abbr>. In the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Historia Sancti Florentii Salmurensis">Hist. S. Flor. Salm.</abbr></i> (Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglises</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 260)</cite>
is a
proverb “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bellum Conquerentium quo tortum superavit rectum</span>”—an
obvious pun on Conan’s nickname, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tortus</span>” or “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curvus</span>.”
It is there quoted as having arisen from the battle of Conquereux
in 992—the only one which it suits the Angevin writers
to admit. But this is nonsense, for the writer has himself just
told us that in that battle Conan was defeated and slain. Therefore
“the crooked overcame the straight,” <i>i.e.</i> Conan won the
victory, in an earlier battle of Conquereux.</p>

<p>But how then are we to account for the Chronicle of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
Brieuc’s very circumstantial statement of Conan’s defeat?—This
chronicle—a late compilation—is our only authority for all the
details of the war; for Guerech’s capture and homage, and in
short for all matters specially relating to Nantes. The tone of
all this part of it shews plainly that its compiler, or more likely
the earlier writer whom he was here copying, was a violently
patriotic man of Nantes, who hated the Rennes party and the
Angevins about equally, and whose chief aim was to depreciate
them both and exalt the house of Nantes in the person of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
Guerech. So great is his spite against the Angevins that he will
not even allow them the credit of having slain Conan at the
second battle of Conquereux, but says Conan fell in a fight with
some rebel subjects of his own! He therefore still more naturally
ignores the Angevin share in the first battle of Conquereux, and
makes his hero Guerech into a triumphant victor. The cause of
his hatred to Anjou is of course the mean trick whereby Geoffrey
obtained Guerech’s homage. There can be little doubt that the
battle was after this homage—was in fact caused by it; but the
facts are quite enough to account for the Nantes writer putting, as
he does, the battle first, before he brings the Angevins in at all, and
giving all the glory to Guerech.</p>

<p>2. As to the Poitevin war. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Excussit Laudunum</span>,” etc.
    (<cite>Fulk
Rechin, Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 376</cite>.
See above, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <a href="#Page_137" title="Go to page 137">137</a>).</p>

<p>The only other mention of this war is in the <abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicon Sancti Maxentii">Chron. S. Maxent.</abbr>
(Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglises</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 384), which says: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Eo tempore gravissimum
bellum inter Willelmum ducem et Gofridum Andegavensem comitem
peractum est. Sed Gaufridus, necessitatibus actus, Willelmo duci
se subdidit seque in manibus præbuit, et ab eo Lausdunum castrum
cum nonnullis aliis in Pictavensi pago beneficio accepit.</span>” <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr>
Mabille pronounces these two accounts incompatible; but are they?
The Poitevin account, taken literally and alone, looks rather odd.
William and Geoffrey fight; Geoffrey is “compelled by necessity”
to make submission to William—but he is invested by his conqueror
with Loudun and other fiefs. That is, the practical gain is
on the side of the beaten party. On the other hand, Fulk Rechin,
taken literally and alone, gives no hint of any submission on
Geoffrey’s part. But why cannot the two accounts be made to
supplement and correct each other, as in the case of the Breton
war? The story would then stand thus: Geoffrey takes Loudun
and defeats William at Les Roches, as Fulk says. Subsequent
reverses compel him to agree to terms so far that he holds his conquests
as fiefs of the count of Poitou.</p>

<p>The case is nearly parallel to that of the Breton war; again the
Angevin count and the hostile chronicler tell the story between
them, each telling the half most agreeable to himself, and the two
halves fit into a whole.</p>

<p><abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Mabille’s last objection is that the real Fulk Rechin would
have known better than to say that Geoffrey pursued William as far
as Mirebeau, a place which had no existence till the castle was built
by Fulk Nerra in 1000. Why should he not have meant simply
“the place where Mirebeau now stands”? And even if he did
think the name existed in Greygown’s day, what does that prove
against his identity? Why should not Count Fulk make slips as
well as other people?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span></p>

<p>The date of the war is matter of guess-work. The <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Maxentian
chronicler’s “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">eo tempore</span>” comes between 989 and 996, <i>i.e.</i> after
Geoffrey’s death. One can only conjecture that it should have come
just at the close of his life.</p>

<span class="note_title">THE GRANT OF MAINE TO GEOFFREY GREYGOWN.</span></h4>

<p>That a grant of the county of Maine was made by Hugh Capet
to a count of Anjou is pretty clear from the later history; that the
grant was made to Geoffrey Greygown is not so certain. The
story comes only from the Angevin historians; and they seem to
have systematically carried back to the time of Greygown all the
claims afterwards put forth by the counts of Anjou to what did not
belong to them. They evidently knew nothing of his real history,
so they used him as a convenient lay figure on which to hang all
pretensions that wanted a foundation and all stories that wanted a
hero, in total defiance of facts and dates. They have transferred
to him one exploit whose hero, if he was an Angevin count at all,
could only have been Fulk Nerra—the capture of Melun in 999.
An examination of this story will be more in place when we
come to the next count; but it rouses a suspicion that after all
Geoffrey may have had no more to do with Maine than with
Melun.—The story of the grant of Maine in the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta Consulum</i>
(Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 77, 78)</cite>
stands thus: David, count
of Maine, and Geoffrey, count of Corbon, refuse homage to king
Robert. The king summons his barons to help him, among them
the count of Anjou. The loyal Geoffrey takes his rebel namesake’s
castle of Mortagne and compels him to submit to the king; David
still holds out, whereupon Robert makes a formal grant of “him
and his Cenomannia” to Greygown and his heirs for ever.</p>

<p>On this <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> l’abbé</span> Voisin
    (<cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Cénomans anciens et modernes</i>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 337</cite>) remarks: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cette chronique renferme avec un fonds de
vérité des détails évidemment érronés; le Geoffroy d’Anjou,
dont il est ici question, n’est pas suffisamment connu. C’est à lui
que Guillaume de Normandie fait rendre hommage par son fils
Robert; c’est lui, sans doute, qui, suivant les historiens de Mayenne,
fut seigneur de cette ville et commanda quelque temps dans le
Maine et l’Anjou, sous Louis d’Outremer; au milieu d’une assemblée
des comtes et des barons de son parti, Robert l’aurait investi de ce
qu’il possédait alors dans ces deux provinces.</span>”</p>

<p>The Abbé’s story is quite as puzzling as the monk’s. His mention
of Robert of Normandy is inexplicable, for it can refer to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
nothing but the homage of Robert Curthose to Geoffrey the
Bearded in 1063. His meaning, however, seems to be that the
Geoffrey in question was not Greygown at all, but another
Geoffrey of whom he says in <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 353 that he was son of Aubert
of Lesser Maine, and “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gouverneur d’Anjou et du Maine, sous
Louis <abbr title="4">IV.</abbr> roi de France; il avait épousé une dame de la maison
de Bretagne, dont on ignore le nom; il eu eut trois fils; Juhel,
Aubert et Guérin; il mourut l’an 890</span>.” This passage <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr> Voisin
gives as a quotation, but without a reference. He then goes on:
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nous avons cherché précédemment à expliquer de quelle manière
ce Geoffroi se serait posé en rival de Hugues-David</span>;” and he
adds a note: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D’autres aimeront peut-être mieux supposer une
erreur de nom et de date dans la Chronique” <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">[what chronicle?]</span>
“et dire qu’il s’agit de Foulques-le-Bon.</span>” There is no need to
“suppose”; a man who died in 890 could not be count of
anything under Louis <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr> But where did <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr> Voisin find this
other Geoffrey, and how does his appearance mend the matter?
He seems to think the Gesta-writers have transferred this man’s
doings to their own hero Greygown, by restoring them to what he
considers their rightful owner he finds no difficulty in accepting the
date, <i>temp.</i> King Robert. But the Abbé’s King Robert is not the
Gesta-writers’ King Robert. <em>He</em> means Robert <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, in 923; <em>they</em>
mean Robert <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, though no doubt they have confused the two. In
default of evidence for <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr> Voisin’s story we must take that of the
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta</i> as it stands and see what can be made of it.</p>

<p>In 923, the time of Robert <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, Geoffrey Greygown was not born,
and Anjou was held by his grandfather Fulk the Red. In 996–1031,
the time of Robert <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, Geoffrey was dead, and Anjou was
held by his son Fulk the Black. Moreover, according to <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr> Voisin,
David of Maine died at latest in 970, and Geoffrey of Corbon lived
1026–1040.</p>

<p>From all this it results:</p>

<p>1. If Maine was granted to a count of Anjou by Robert <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, it
was not to Geoffrey Greygown.</p>

<p>2. If it was granted by Robert <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, it was also not to Geoffrey.</p>

<p>3. If it was granted to Geoffrey, it can only have been by Hugh
Capet.</p>

<p>There is one writer who does bring Hugh into the affair:
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Electo autem a Francis communi consilio, post obitum Lotharii,
Hugone Capet in regem ... cum regnum suum circuiret, Turonisque
descendens <em>Cenomannensibusque consulem imponeret</em></span>,” etc.
    (<cite><i><abbr title="Gesta Ambaziensium Dominorum" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta
Ambaz. Domin.</abbr></i>, Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 160</cite>). He does not say who
this new count was, but there can be little doubt it was the reigning
count of Anjou; and this, just after Hugh’s accession, would
be Fulk Nerra. On the other hand, the writer ignores Louis <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
and makes Hugh succeed Lothar. Did he mean to place these
events in that year, 986–7, when Hugh was king <em>de facto</em> but not
<em>de jure</em>? In that case the count would be Geoffrey Greygown.</p>

<p>The compilers of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta</i>, however, simplify all these old
claims by stating that the king (<i>i.e.</i> the duke) gave Geoffrey a sort
of carte-blanche to take and keep anything he could get: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">dedit
Gosfrido comiti quidquid Rex Lotarius in episcopatibus suis habuerat,
Andegavensi scilicet et Cenomannensi. Si qua vero alia ipse vel

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">One</span> of the wildest of the legends which have gathered
round the Angevin house tells how a count of Anjou had
wedded a lady of unknown origin and more than earthly
beauty, who excited the suspicions of those around her by
her marked dislike to entering a church, and her absolute
refusal to be present at the consecration of the Host. At
last her husband, urged by his friends, resolved to compel
her to stay. By his order, when the Gospel was ended and
she was about to leave the church as usual, she was stopped
by four armed men. As they laid hold of her mantle she
shook it from her shoulders; two of her little children stood
beneath its folds at her right hand, two at her left. The
two former she left behind, the latter she caught up in her
arms, and, floating away through a window of the church,
she was seen on earth no more. “What wonder,” was the
comment of Richard Cœur-de-Lion upon this story; “what
wonder if we lack the natural affections of mankind—we
who come from the devil, and must needs go back to the
devil?”<a id="Anchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 293.">[293]</a></p>

<p>One is tempted to think that the excited brains of the
closing tenth century, filled with dim presages of horror that
were floating about in expectation of the speedy end of the
world, must have wrought out this strange tale by way of
explaining the career of Fulk the Black.<a id="Anchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 294.">[294]</a> His contemporaries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
may well have reckoned him among the phenomena of
the time; they may well have had recourse to a theory of
supernatural agency or demoniac possession to account for
the rapid developement of talents and passions which both
alike seemed almost more than human. When the county
of Anjou was left to him by the death of his father Geoffrey
Greygown, Fulk was a child scarce eight years old.<a id="Anchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 295.">[295]</a> Surrounded
by powerful foes whom Geoffrey’s aggressions had
provoked rather than checked—without an ally or protector
unless it were the new king—Fulk began life with everything
against him. Yet before he has reached the years of
manhood the young count meets us at every turn, and
always in triumph. Throughout the fifty-three years of his
reign Fulk is one of the most conspicuous and brilliant
figures in French history. His character seems at times
strangely self-contradictory. Mad bursts of passion, which
would have been the ruin of an ordinary man, but which
seem scarcely to have made a break in his cool, calculating,
far-seeing policy; a rapid and unerring perception of his
own ends, a relentless obstinacy in pursuing them, an utter
disregard of the wrong and suffering which their pursuit
might involve; and then ever and anon fits of vehement
repentance, ignorant, blind, fruitless as far as any lasting
amendment was concerned, yet at once awe-striking and
touching in its short-lived, wrong-headed earnestness—all
these seeming contradictions yet make up, not a puzzling
abstraction, but an intensely living character—the character,
in a word, of the typical Angevin count.</p>

<p>For more than a hundred years after the accession of
Hugh Capet, the history of the kingdom which he founded
consists chiefly of the struggles of the great feudataries
among themselves to get and to keep control over the action
of the crown. The duke of the French had gained little
save in name by his royal coronation and unction. He was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145">145</a></span>
no nearer than his Karolingian predecessors had been to
actual supremacy over the Norman duchy, the Breton
peninsula, and the whole of southern Gaul. Aquitaine
indeed passed from cold contempt to open aggression.
When one of her princes, the count of Poitou, had at length
made unwilling submission to the northern king, a champion
of southern independence issued from far Périgord to punish
him, stormed Poitiers, marched up to the Loire, and sat
down in triumph before Tours, whose count, Odo of Blois,
was powerless to relieve it. The king himself could find no
more practical remonstrance than the indignant question,
“Who made thee count?” and the sole reply vouchsafed by
Adalbert of Périgord was the fair retort, “Who made thee
king?” Tours fell into his hands, and was made over, perhaps
in mockery, to the youthful count of Anjou. The
loyalty of its governor and citizens, however, soon restored
it to its lawful owner, and Adalbert’s dreams of conquest
ended in failure and retreat.<a id="Anchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 296.">[296]</a> Still, Aquitaine remained independent
as of old; Hugh’s real kingdom took in little
more than the old duchy of France “between Seine and
Loire”; and even within these limits it almost seemed that
in grasping at the shadow of the crown he had loosened his
hold on the substance of his ducal power. The regal
authority was virtually a tool in the hands of whichever
feudatary could secure its exercise for his own ends. As
yet Aquitaine and Britanny stood aloof from the struggle;
Normandy had not yet entered upon it; at present therefore
it lay between the vassals of the duchy of France. Foremost
among them in power, wealth, and extent of territory
was the count of Blois, Chartres and Tours. His dominions
pressed close against the eastern border of Anjou, and it was
on her ability to cope with him that her fate chiefly depended.
Was the house of Anjou or the house of Blois to
win the pre-eminence in central Gaul? This was the problem
which confronted Fulk the Black, and to whose solution
he devoted his life. His whole course was governed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
one fixed principle and directed to one paramount object—the
consolidation of his marchland. To that object everything
else was made subservient. Every advantage thrown
in his way by circumstances, by the misfortunes, mistakes
or weaknesses of foes or friends—for he used the one as
unscrupulously as the other—was caught up and pursued
with relentless vigour. One thread of settled policy ran
through the seemingly tangled skein of his life, a thread
never broken even by the wildest outbursts of his almost
demoniac temper or his superstitious alarms. While he
seemed to be throwing his whole energies into the occupation
of the moment—whether it were the building or the
besieging of a fortress, the browbeating of bishop or king,
the cajoling of an ally or the crushing of a rival on the
battle-field—that work was in reality only a part of a much
greater work. Every town mirrored in the clear streams
that water the “garden of France”—as the people of
Touraine call their beautiful country—has its tale of the
Black Count, the “great builder” beneath whose hands the
whole lower course of the Loire gradually came to bristle
with fortresses; but far above all his castles of stone and
mortar there towered a castle in the air, the plan of a mighty
political edifice. Every act of his life was a step towards
its realization; every fresh success in his long career of
triumph was another stone added to the gradual building up
of Angevin dominion and greatness.</p>

<p>Fulk’s first victory was won before he was fourteen, over
a veteran commander who had been more than a match for
his father ten years earlier. The death of Geoffrey Greygown
was soon followed by that of Count Guerech of
Nantes; he, too, left only a young son, Alan; and when
Alan also died in 990, Conan of Rennes, already master of
all the rest of Britanny, seized his opportunity to take
forcible possession of Nantes,<a id="Anchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 297.">[297]</a> little dreaming of a possible
rival in his young brother-in-law beyond the Mayenne.
While his back was turned and he was busy assembling
troops at Bruerech, at the other end of Britanny, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Angevin worked upon the old hatred of the Nantes people
to the house of Rennes; with the craft of his race he
won over some of the guards, by fair words and solid bribes,
till he gained admittance into the city and received oaths
and hostages from its inhabitants. He then returned home
to collect troops for an attack upon the citadel, which was
held by Conan’s men. Conan, as soon as he heard the tidings,
marched upon Nantes with all his forces; as before, he
brought with him a body of Norman auxiliaries, likely to be
of no small use in assaulting a place such as Nantes, whose
best defence is its broad river—for the “Pirates” had not
yet forgotten the days when the water was their natural
element and the long keels were their most familiar home.
While the Norman ships blocked the river, Conan’s troops
beset the town by land, and thus, with the garrison shooting
down at them from the citadel, the townsfolk of Nantes were
between three fires when Fulk advanced to their rescue.<a id="Anchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 298.">[298]</a>
Conan at once sent the audacious boy a challenge to meet
him, on such a day, in a pitched battle on the field of Conquereux,
where ten years before a doubtful fight had been
waged between Conan and Fulk’s father. This time the
Bretons trusted to lure their enemies to complete destruction
by a device which, in days long after, was successfully
employed by Robert Bruce against the English army at
Bannockburn; they dug a series of trenches right across the
swampy moor, covered them with bushes, branches, leaves
and thatch, supported by uprights stuck into the ditches,
and strewed the surface with ferns till it was indistinguishable
from the surrounding moorland. Behind this line of
hidden pitfalls Conan drew up his host, making a feint of
unwillingness to begin the attack. Fulk, panting for his
first battle with all the ardour of youth, urged his men to
the onset; the flower of the Angevin troops charged right
into the Breton pitfalls; men and horses became hopelessly
entangled; two thousand went down in the swampy abyss
and were drowned, slaughtered or crushed to death.<a id="Anchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 299.">[299]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
rest fled in disorder; Fulk himself was thrown from his
horse and fell to the ground, weighed down by his armour,
perhaps too heavy for his boyish frame. In an instant he
was up again, wild with rage, burning to avenge his overthrow,
calling furiously upon his troops. The clear, young
voice of their leader revived the courage of the Angevins;
“as the storm-wind sweeps down upon the thick corn-rigs”<a id="Anchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 300.">[300]</a>—so
their historian tells—they rushed upon the foe; and their
momentary panic was avenged by the death of Conan and
the almost total destruction of his host.<a id="Anchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 301.">[301]</a> The blow overthrew
the power of Rennes; the new duke Geoffrey, the son
of Conan and Hermengard, was far indeed from being a
match for his young uncle. In the flush of victory Fulk
marched into Nantes; the citizens received him with open
arms; the dismayed garrison speedily surrendered, and
swore fealty to the conqueror; the titular bishop, Judicaël, a
young son of Count Hoel, was set up as count under the
guardianship of Aimeric of Thouars, a kinsman of the Angevin
house, who ruled solely in Fulk’s interest;<a id="Anchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 302.">[302]</a> while the
territory on the right bank of the Mayenne, lost a century
and a half before by the treason of Count Lambert, seems to
have been reunited to the Angevin dominions.</p>

<p>The boy count had well won his spurs on the field of
Conquereux. With the control over Nantes he had secured
the control over the whole course of the Loire from his own
capital down to the sea—a most important advantage in an
age when the water-ways were the principal channels of
communication, whether for peace or war. The upper part
of the Loire valley, its richest and most fertile part, was in
the hands of the count of Blois. But his sway was not unbroken.
Midway between his two capitals, Blois and Tours,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
stood Amboise, the heritage of the Red Count’s mother;
farther south, in the valley of the Indre, stood Loches, the
heritage of his wife. It was not in human nature—certainly
not in Angevin nature—that the owner of Amboise and
Loches should not seek to extend his power a little further
at the expense of his neighbour in Touraine; and no great
provocation on the part of Odo of Blois was needed to make
the fiery young Angevin dash into his territories, and ride
plundering, wasting and burning to the outskirts of Blois
itself.<a id="Anchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 303.">[303]</a> Raid and counter-raid went on almost without ceasing,
and once it seems that King Hugh himself came to help
his Angevin ally.<a id="Anchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 304.">[304]</a> In 995 Odo died, and his widow,
Bertha, shortly afterwards married Robert of France, who
next year became king on the death of his father Hugh Capet.
Robert and Bertha were cousins; the Church pronounced
their marriage illegal, and punished it with an interdict on the
realm; amid the general confusion which followed, Fulk
carried on a desultory warfare with Odo’s two elder sons,
Thierry and Theobald, till the death of the latter in 1004
brought him face to face with his lifelong antagonist, Odo
<abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> The contest made inevitable by circumstances was to
be rendered all the more bitter by the character of the two
men who were now to engage in it. Odo, indeed, was even
yet scarcely more than a boy;<a id="Anchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 305.">[305]</a> but, like Fulk, he had begun
his public career at a very early age. His beginning was as
characteristic as Fulk’s beginning at Conquereux. In 999
he openly insulted his royal step-father by wresting the castle
of Melun from Robert’s most trusty counsellor, Count Burchard
of Vendôme; and no might short of that of the Norman
duke, who had now grown from a “leader of the Pirates”
into the king’s most valued supporter, sufficed to avenge the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
outrage.<a id="Anchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 306.">[306]</a> The boy’s hasty, unprovoked spoliation of Burchard,
his insolent defiance of the king, his overweening self-confidence,
ending suddenly in ignominious flight, were typical
of his whole after-career. Odo’s life was as busy and
active as Fulk’s, but his activity produced no lasting effects.
His insatiable ambition lacked the restraint and regulation
of the Angevin practical sagacity, and ran hopelessly to seed
without bringing forth any lasting fruit. There was no fixed
purpose in his life. New ideas, daring schemes, sprang
up in his brain almost as quickly as in that of Fulk;
but he never waited till they were matured; he never
stopped to count their cost; and instead of working together
to one common end, they only drove him into a multiplicity
of irreconcileable and often visionary undertakings which
never came to perfection. He was entirely a creature of
impulse; always ready to throw himself into a new project,
but generally lacking patience and perseverance enough
to carry it through; harassed by numberless conflicting
cares;<a id="Anchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 307.">[307]</a> breaking every engagement as soon as made, not
from any deep-laid policy, but simply from sheer inability to
keep long to anything. “Unstable as water, thou shalt not
excel,” might have been the burthen of Odo and of Odo’s
whole race. The house of Blois failed through their utter
lack of the quality which was the main strength of their
rivals: thoroughness. The rivalry and the characters of the
two houses have a bearing upon English history; for the
quarrel that began between them for the possession of
Touraine was to be fought out at last on English ground,
and for no less a stake than the crown of England. The
rivalry of Odo and Fulk was a foreshadowing of the
rivalry between Stephen of Blois and Henry of Anjou. The
end was the same in both cases. With every advantage on
their side, in the eleventh century as in the twelfth, in Gaul
as in England, the aimless activity of the house of Blois only
spent itself against the indomitable steadiness, determination<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
and persistency of the Angevins, as vainly as the storm-wind
might beat upon the rocky foundations of Black Angers.</p>

<p>In the ten years of misery and confusion which followed
the death of Odo <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> and the re-marriage of his widow, Fulk
had time nearly to complete a chain of fortresses which,
starting from Angers and sweeping along the line of Geoffrey
Greygown’s Poitevin conquests in a wide irregular half-circle
up again to Amboise, served the double purpose of linking
his own outlying possessions in Touraine with his head-quarters
in Anjou, and of cutting in halves the dominions
of his neighbour. The towers of Montreuil, Passavant and
Maulévrier, of Loudun and the more remote Mirebeau, were
a standing menace to Saumur and Chinon. <abbr title="Sainte-Maure">Sᵗᵉ·-Maure</abbr> was
an eyesore to the garrison of Ile-Bouchard.<a id="Anchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 308.">[308]</a> Farther east,
on a pile of rock with the little blue Indre winding round its
foot, rose, as it rises still in ruined majesty, the mighty keep
of Loches; and on the banks of the Indrois that of Montrésor,
whose lord, Roger, rejoiced in the surname of “the
devil.”<a id="Anchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 309.">[309]</a> To Roger Fulk also intrusted the command of
another great fortress, Montrichard, whose dark donjon
frowned down upon the Cher from a plot of ground stolen
from the metropolitan see of Tours.<a id="Anchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 310.">[310]</a> At Amboise itself, the
site of the Roman governor’s palace—now crowned by the
modern castle—was occupied by a strong <i>domicilium</i> of
the Angevin count,<a id="Anchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 311.">[311]</a> and the place was a perpetual obstacle
between the archiepiscopal city of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin and the secular
capital of its rulers. Langeais and Montbazon, which for a
while threatened Tours more closely still, were soon wrested
from their daring builder;<a id="Anchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 312.">[312]</a> but the whole course of the
Indre above Montbazon was none the less in Fulk’s hands,
for either by force or guile, the lords of all the castles on its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
banks had been won over to his cause; he had gained a
foothold on every one of the affluents of the Loire upon its
southern side; while on the north, in the valley of the Loir,
Hugh of Alluye, the lord of Château-la-Vallière and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>-Christophe,
was so devoted to the Angevin interest that
the count’s usual route to and from Amboise lay through
his lands.<a id="Anchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 313.">[313]</a></p>

<p>The early part of the eleventh century was an age of
castle-building; Fulk, however, had begun his line of fortifications
before the century dawned, in those gloomy years
of interdict when the royal power was at its lowest ebb,
when the people, cut off from the helps and comforts of
religion, lay in hopeless anarchy and misery, and half in
terror, half in longing, men whispered to each other that the
end of the world was near. The superstitious terrors which
paralyzed gentler souls only goaded Fulk into more restless
activity and inflamed his fierce temper almost to madness.
He had married the heiress of Vendôme, the daughter of
Count Burchard;<a id="Anchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 314.">[314]</a> but this union came to a terrible end
while its only child was still in her cradle. In the very
dawn of the dreaded year 1000 Countess Elizabeth expiated
her real or supposed sins as a wife by death at the stake;
and a conflagration which destroyed a large part of the city
of Angers immediately after her execution may well have
caused the horror-stricken subjects of her husband to deem
that judgement was indeed at their gates.<a id="Anchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 315.">[315]</a></p>

<p>After the paroxysm came the reaction. When the
dreaded year had passed over and the world found itself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
still alive; when the king had at last consented to purchase
relief from the interdict by parting from his beloved Bertha,
and the nation was rousing itself to welcome the new queen
who stepped into Bertha’s place; then the blood which he
had shed at Conquereux and elsewhere—one may surely
add, the ashes of his wife—began to weigh heavily on the
Black Count’s soul; “the fear of Gehenna” took possession
of him, and leaving the marchland to the care of his brother
Maurice he set out for the Holy Sepulchre.<a id="Anchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 316.">[316]</a> This journey
was the first link in a chain which, through the later pilgrimages
of Fulk Nerra himself and those of his great-grandson
Fulk <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr>, brought the counts of Anjou into a specially intimate
relation with the Holy Land and led to the establishment of
an Angevin dynasty upon its throne. Legend has not been
slack to furnish Fulk the Palmer with characteristic adventures,
to tell how his craft outwitted that of the Turks who
tried to exclude him from the Sepulchre, and how he not
only procured a piece of the true Cross, but while kissing the
sacred stone in the fervour of his devotion, detected a loose
fragment which he managed to bite off and bring home as
the most precious trophy of his journey.<a id="Anchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 317.">[317]</a> His first care on
his return was to build an abbey for the reception of this
relic. From the rocky angle by the winding Indre where
the great “Square Tower”—as the natives emphatically
call the keep of Loches—was rising in picturesque contrast
to a church reared by Geoffrey Greygown in honour of our
Lady,<a id="Anchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 318.">[318]</a> the land which the wife of the first count of Anjou
had transmitted to her descendants stretched a mile eastward

waste plot of ground full of broom, belonging to a man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
named Ingelger. From its original Latin name, <i>Belli-locus</i>,
now corrupted into Beaulieu, it seems possible that the place
was set apart for trials by ordeal of battle.<a id="Anchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 319.">[319]</a></p>

<p>This field Fulk determined to purchase for the site of
his abbey. A bargain was struck; the count paid down the
stipulated sum, carried the former owner on his shoulders
from the middle of the field to the foot of the bridge, and
there set him down, saying, “A man without wit his freehold
must quit”—by which ceremony the contract was
completed.<a id="Anchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 320.">[320]</a> Despite his fiery haste, Fulk did all things
with due method,<a id="Anchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 321.">[321]</a> and his next anxiety was to decide upon
the dedication of his intended minster. He found his best
counsellor in his newly-married wife, the Lady Hildegard,
and by her advice the church was placed under the direct
invocation, not of saint or angel, but of the most Holy
Trinity Itself.<a id="Anchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 322.">[322]</a> By the time it stood ready for consecration
the son of Fulk and Hildegard was nearly three years old:<a id="Anchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 323.">[323]</a>
he had been nursed by a blacksmith’s wife at Loches;<a id="Anchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 324.">[324]</a> and
many a time, as the count and countess went to inspect the
progress of architect and builder in the meadow beyond the
river, they must have lingered beside the forge to mark the
growth of their little Geoffrey, the future conqueror of Tours.
The consecration of the church proved a difficulty; the archbishop
of Tours refused to perform it unless Fulk would
restore to his see the stolen land of Montrichard.<a id="Anchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 325.">[325]</a> Fulk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
swore—doubtless his customary oath, “by God’s souls”<a id="Anchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 326.">[326]</a>—that
he would get the better of the primate, and went
straight off to Rome to lay his case before the Pope. After
several years’ wrangling it was decided in his favour,<a id="Anchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 327.">[327]</a> and
one morning in May 1012 the abbey-church of the Holy
Trinity at Beaulieu was hallowed with all due pomp and
solemnity by a Roman cardinal-legate. But though Rome
had spoken, the case was not ended yet. That very afternoon
a sudden storm of wind blew up from the south, whirled
round the church, and swept the whole roof completely off.
Clergy and laity alike seized on the prodigy as an evident
token of Heaven’s wrath against the insolence and presumption
of Fulk;<a id="Anchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 328.">[328]</a> not so the Black Count himself, who
simply replaced the roof and pushed on the completion of
the monastic buildings as if nothing had happened.<a id="Anchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 329.">[329]</a> He
had successfully defied the Church; he next ventured to
defy the king and the count of Blois both at once. The
divorced queen Bertha, mother of young Odo of Blois, still
lived and was still loved by the king; Fulk, if he was not
actually, as tradition relates, a kinsman of the new Queen
Constance,<a id="Anchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 330.">[330]</a> was at any rate fully alive to the policy of making
common cause with her against their common rivals of
Blois. He crushed King Robert’s last hope of reunion with
Bertha by sending twelve armed men to assassinate at a
hunting-party, before his royal master’s eyes, the king’s
seneschal or <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">comes palatii</i> Hugh of Beauvais who was the
confidant of his cherished scheme.<a id="Anchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 331.">[331]</a> It is a striking proof
not only of the royal helplessness but also of the independence
and security which Fulk had already attained that his
crime went altogether unpunished and even uncensured save<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
by one bishop,<a id="Anchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 332.">[332]</a> and almost immediately after its commission
he could again venture on leaving his dominions under the
regency of his brother Maurice, while he set off upon another
long journey which the legendary writers of Anjou, by some
strange confusion between their own hero and the Emperor
Otto <abbr title="3">III.</abbr>, make into a mission of knight-errantry to deliver
the Pope from a tyrant named Crescentius, but which seems
really to have been a second pilgrimage to Holy Land.<a id="Anchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 333.">[333]</a>
He came back to find the storm which had so long been
gathering on his eastern border on the point of breaking at
last.</p>

<p>The adherents of the count of Blois, headed by Landry
of Châteaudun, had profited by Fulk’s absence to concert a
scheme for the expulsion of the Angevins from Touraine.
In spite of a vigorous resistance made by Fulk’s lieutenant
at Amboise, Sulpice, treasurer of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin’s at Tours, they
seemed in a fair way to succeed, when Fulk himself dropped
like a thunderbolt in their midst, dashed right through the
county of Blois into that of Chartres, punished Landry by
sacking Châteaudun and harrying the surrounding district,
and marched home in triumph to Amboise.<a id="Anchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 334.">[334]</a> A raid such
as this was a distinct declaration of war, not upon Landry,
but upon Landry’s lord. Fulk had intended it as such,
and he went home to set in action every possible means that
could gain him help and support in a fight to the uttermost
with Odo for the possession of Touraine. At that very
moment the county of Maine was thrown virtually into his
hands by the death of its aged count Hugh; with the alliance
of Hugh’s youthful successor he secured the northern
frontier of Touraine and the support of a body of valiant
fighting-men whose co-operation soon proved to be of the
highest value and importance. The rapid insight which
singled out at a glance the most fitting instruments for his
purpose, the gifts of attraction and persuasion by which he
knew how to attach men to his service, and seemed almost
to inspire them with some faint reflex of his own spirit,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
while making them devoted creatures of his will, were all
brought into play as he cast about in all directions for aid
in the coming struggle, and were strikingly shown in his
choice of a lieutenant. The instinct of genius told him that
he had found the man he wanted in young Lisoy, lord of
the castle of Bazogers, in Maine. As prudent in counsel as
he was daring in fight, Lisoy was a man after Fulk’s own
heart; they understood each other at once; Lisoy was appointed
to share with the now aged Sulpice the supreme
command of Loches and Amboise; and while Sulpice provided
for the defence of Amboise by building on his own
land there a lofty tower of stone,<a id="Anchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 335.">[335]</a> the burned and plundered
districts of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>-Aignan, Chaumont and Blois soon had cause
to know that the “pride of Cenomannian knighthood” had
thrown himself heart and soul into the service of the count
of Anjou.<a id="Anchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 336.">[336]</a></p>

<p>The crisis came in the summer of 1016, when Odo of
Blois gathered all his forces for an attack upon Montrichard.
His rival was fully prepared to meet him. Before he set out
from Blois, the allied hosts of Anjou and Maine had assembled
at Amboise, and thence separated again to post themselves
in such a manner as to render a battle unavoidable. Fulk
turned eastward, and took up a position close to Pontlevoy,
seemingly in a wood now known as the Bois-Royal, which
in that day was skirted by the high road from Blois to
Montrichard. Herbert of Maine rode down to the banks of
the Cher, and pitched his camp just above Montrichard, at
Bourré.<a id="Anchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 337.">[337]</a> If Odo followed the high road he would be met
by the Angevins; if he contrived to turn their position by
taking a less direct route to the eastward, he must encounter
the Cenomannians, with the garrison of Montrichard
at their back; while whichever engaged him first, the distance
between the two bodies of troops was so slight that either
could easily come to the other’s assistance. It was well for
Anjou and for her count that his strategical arrangements
were so perfect, and so faithfully carried out by his young<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
ally; for never in all his long life, save in the panic at Conquereux,
was Fulk the Black so near to complete overthrow
as on that Friday morning in July 1016, when he met Odo
of Blois face to face in the battle-field.</p>

<p>Odo, who always trusted to be saved by the multitude of
an host,<a id="Anchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 338.">[338]</a> was greatly astonished, on arriving with all his
forces opposite Pontlevoy, to find the Angevins drawn up
against him in battle array. With a few hurried words he
urged his men to the onset. Fortune seemed for a while to
favour the stronger side; Fulk and his troops were sore
bested; Fulk himself was thrown from his horse and severely
stunned, and the fate of Anjou hung trembling in the balance,
when the scale was turned by the sword of Herbert of Maine.
A messenger hurried off to tell the Cenomannian count that
his friend was defeated, nay, captured. Herbert and his
knights flew to the rescue; they charged the left wing of
the enemies with a vigour which changed the whole position
of affairs, and snatched from the count of Blois the victory
he had all but won; the chivalry of Blois fled in confusion,
leaving the foot to be cut to pieces at will, and their camp to
be plundered by the victorious allies, who returned in triumph
to Amboise, laden with rich spoils and valuable prisoners.<a id="Anchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 339.">[339]</a></p>

<p>The victory of Pontlevoy was the turning-point of Fulk’s
career. Nine years passed away before Odo recovered from
the check enough to make any attempt to avenge it. It
seems at first glance strange that Fulk did not employ the
interval in pushing forward his conquest of Touraine. But
in the eyes of both Fulk and Odo the possession of Touraine
was in reality a means rather than an end; and a sort of
armed truce, so long as Odo did not provoke him to break
it, suited Fulk’s purpose better than a continued war. His
western frontier had been secured by his first victory at
Conquereux; his eastern frontier was now secured, at any
rate for a time, by his victory at Pontlevoy; from the south<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
there was nothing to fear, for the duke of Aquitaine, to
whom he owed homage for Loudun, was his staunch friend,
and presently gave proof of his friendship by bestowing on
him the city of Saintes.<a id="Anchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 340.">[340]</a> Fulk at once made use of the
gift as a means of extorting something yet more valuable
from a neighbour to whom he owed a far deeper obligation—Herbert
of Maine. It may be that they had quarrelled
since the days of Pontlevoy; it may be that Herbert had
begun that career of nocturnal raids against the fortified
towns of Anjou which scared men and beasts from their
rest, and gained him his unclassical but expressive surname
of “Wake-the-dog.”<a id="Anchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 341.">[341]</a> If so, the wily Angevin took
effectual measures to stop them. He enticed the count of
Maine to pay him a visit at Saintes, proposing to grant him
the investiture of that city. Suddenly, in the midst of conversation,
Herbert was seized by Fulk’s servants and flung
into prison, whence he was only released at the end of two
years, and on submission to such conditions as Fulk chose
to dictate.<a id="Anchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 342.">[342]</a> What those conditions were history does not
tell; but there can be little doubt that they included some
acknowledgment of the suzerain rights of Anjou over Maine,
with which Geoffrey Greygown had been invested by Hugh
Capet, but which he had not had time to make good, and
which Fulk had only enforced for a moment, at the sword’s
point, when the aged count Hugh was dying.<a id="Anchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 343.">[343]</a> Fulk’s dealings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160">160</a></span>
with Maine are only an episode in his life; but they
led even more directly than his struggle with the house of
Blois to consequences of the utmost importance. They
paved the way for an Angevin conquest of Maine which
extended the Angevin power to the Norman border, brought
it into contact and collision with the Norman ducal house,
and originated the long wars which were ended at last by
the marriage of Geoffrey Plantagenet and the Empress
Matilda. The imprisonment of Herbert is really the first
step in the path which leads from Anjou to England.</p>

The terms of Herbert’s submission to
Fulk are matter of inference from what followed his release. He at once began
to quarrel with Avesgaud, the bishop of Le Mans, and being by him defied and
excommunicated, called in the help of Duke Alan of Britanny
    (<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Acta Pontificum Cenomanicum">Acta Pontif.
Cenoman.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 30, in Mabillon, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Vetera Analecta">Vet. Analecta</abbr></i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 304</cite>). Alan, when he had helped
to defeat the bishop, marched down to besiege Le Lude, one of the chief Angevin
fortresses on the Cenomannian border, and only desisted when he had extorted
from Fulk the hostages given him by Herbert on his release;
    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicon Vindocinense">Chron. Vindoc.</abbr> <abbr title="year">a.</abbr>
1027 (Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglises</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 166)</cite>.
It is not hard to see why the rival overlord
of Nantes should be ready to make war, on any pretext, upon the count of
Anjou; but, making due allowance for Fulk’s possible difficulties—Odo’s last
attack occurred in this year—still it is very hard to see why Fulk, “the ingenious
Fulk,” as the writer of the
    <cite><i><abbr title="Gesta Ambaziensium Dominorum" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta Amb. Domin.</abbr></i></cite>
calls him
    (<cite>Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr>
165</cite>), could find no better way of raising the siege of a petty border-fortress than
by making restitution to Herbert at the bidding of Alan, unless he felt so sure of
his hold over Herbert as not to think the hostages worth keeping. The striking
resemblance between Fulk’s treatment of Herbert and his father’s treatment of
Guerech also suggests that there was probably a like resemblance in the terms of
release.

<p>But the step could never have been followed up as it
was by Fulk’s successor had not Fulk himself at once turned
back to his special work of clearing away the obstacle to
Angevin progress formed by the rivalry of Blois, which once
again threatened to become a serious danger in the very year
of Herbert’s capture. Odo had lately<a id="Anchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 344.">[344]</a> succeeded to the inheritance
of his cousin Stephen, count of Champagne, an
acquisition which doubled his wealth and power, and gave
him a position of such importance in the French kingdom as
enabled him to overawe the crown and cause a complete
change in its policy. In 1025 King Robert, “or rather his
queen Constance,” as the chroniclers significantly add, made
peace with Count Odo who had hitherto been their enemy,
and left their old friend Fulk of Anjou to carry on alone<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161">161</a></span>
the struggle which he had begun with their good will, and,
ostensibly at least, partly in their interest.<a id="Anchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 345.">[345]</a> Odo thought
his hour was come; “with all his might he set upon” Fulk;<a id="Anchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 346.">[346]</a>
and his might now included all the forces of Touraine, Blois,
Chartres and Champagne, aided, it seems, by a contingent
from the Royal Domain itself.<a id="Anchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 347.">[347]</a> With this formidable host
Odo laid siege to a great fortified camp known as the Montboyau,
which Fulk had reared some ten years before on the
northern bank of the Loire almost opposite Tours, as a
standing menace to the city and a standing defiance to its
ruler.<a id="Anchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 348.">[348]</a> Fulk, to whom the besieged garrison appealed for
succour, had advanced<a id="Anchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 349.">[349]</a> as far as Brain-sur-Alonnes when he
was met by tidings which induced him to change his course.<a id="Anchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 350.">[350]</a>
Nearly over against the spot where he stood, a ridge of white
chalk-cliff rising sheer above the southern bank of the Loire
was crowned by the fortress of Saumur, the south-western
key of Touraine, close to the Angevin border. It had
belonged to the counts of Tours since the days of Theobald
the Trickster at least; but in an earlier time it had probably
formed a part of the Angevin March, as it still formed a
part of the diocese of Angers. Its lord, Gelduin, was the
sole human being whom the Black Count feared; “Let us
flee that devil of Saumur!” was his cry, “I seem always to
see him before me.”<a id="Anchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 351.">[351]</a> But now he learned that Gelduin had
joined his count at the siege of the Montboyau. A hurried<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162">162</a></span>
night-ride across Loire and Vienne brought Fulk at break of
day to the gates of Saumur,<a id="Anchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 352.">[352]</a> and before sunset he was
master of the place, although its inhabitants, with a spirit
worthy of their absent leader, fired the town before they
surrendered, and only admitted the victors into a heap of
ashes. Not the least valiant of its defenders had been the
monks of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Florence, a little community who dwelt within
the castle-enclosure, keeping guard over the relics of a famous
local saint. As they came forth with their patron’s body
from the blazing ruins, the Black Count’s voice rose above
the din: “Let the fire burn, holy Florence! I will build
thee a better dwelling at Angers.” The relics were placed
in a boat and rowed down the stream till they reached the
limit of the lands of Saumur, at Trèves. Once the boundary
had been further west, at Gennes; till Fulk, despite his
terror of the “devil,” had taken courage to march against
him, doubtless at a moment when Gelduin was unprepared
for defence, for he at once asked a truce. It was granted,
but not exactly as he desired; on the spot where Gelduin’s
envoy met him Fulk planted a castle and called it mockingly
“Treva,” <i>truce</i>. Opposite this alien fortress the boat which
carried the relics of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Florence now stuck fast in one of the
sandbanks of treacherous Loire, and all the efforts of the
rowers failed to move it. The saint—said the monks—was
evidently determined not to be carried beyond his own
territory. Fulk, who was superintending the voyage in
person, began to rail at him as “an impious rustic who would
not allow himself to be well treated”: but there was a grain
of humour in the Black Count’s composition, and he was
probably as much amused as angered at the saint’s obstinacy;
at any rate he suffered the monks to push off in the opposite
direction—which they did without difficulty—and deposit
their charge in the church of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Hilary, an old dependency
of their house, till he should find them a suitable place for a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163">163</a></span>
new monastery.<a id="Anchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 353.">[353]</a> Thus far Odo’s grand expedition had
brought him nothing but the loss of the best stronghold he
possessed on the Angevin border. There was apparently
nothing to prevent Fulk from marching in triumph up the
valley of the Vienne, where Chinon and Ile-Bouchard now
held out alone for the count of Blois amid a ring of
Angevin fortresses. His present object, however, was to
relieve the Montboyau; and turning northward he laid
siege to a castle of his own building which had somehow
passed into the enemy’s hands, Montbazon<a id="Anchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 354.">[354]</a> on the Indre,
only three leagues distant from Tours. Odo, whose siege
operations had proved a most disastrous failure,<a id="Anchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 355.">[355]</a> at once
broke up his camp and marched to the relief of Montbazon.
To dislodge him from the siege of Montboyau was all that
Fulk wanted; simulating flight, he retreated up the valley
to Loches and thence retired gradually upon Amboise.<a id="Anchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 356.">[356]</a> A
month later Odo made an ineffectual attempt to regain
Saumur. Some time afterwards he tried again, pitching his
tents among the vineyards on the banks of the Thouet, hard
by the rising walls of the new abbey of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Florence; the
monks acted as mediators between their former lord and
their new patron, and peace was made, Odo definitely relinquishing
Saumur, and Fulk agreeing to raze the Montboyau<a id="Anchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 357.">[357]</a>—that
is, to raze the keep on its summit; for the
white chalky slopes of the mighty earthwork itself rise
gleaming above the river to this day. The struggle between
Fulk and Odo was virtually over. Once again, in the following
year, the count of Blois attempted to surprise Amboise,
in company with the young King Henry, Robert’s son and
recently crowned colleague. The attack failed;<a id="Anchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 358.">[358]</a> it was
Odo’s last effort to stem the tide of Angevin progress.
Fulk had done more than beat his rival in the battle-field;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
he had out-generalled him in every way, and won a triumph
which made the final issue of their rivalry a foregone conclusion.
That issue he never sought to hasten, for with all
his fiery vehemence Fulk knew how to wait; unlike Odo,
he could look beyond the immediate future, beyond the
horizon of his own life, and having sown and watered his
seed he could be content to leave others to gather its fruit,
rather than risk the frustration of his labours by plucking at
it before the time.</p>

by Herbert of Maine. But, on calculating dates, it seems that Herbert must
have been by this time in prison. It is however highly probable that Cenomannian
troops would be supplied to Fulk by Bishop Avesgaud.

<p>Fulk was now at the height of his prosperity. He had
been count of Anjou for forty years, and his reign had been
one of unbroken success. Each in turn of the greater neighbours
who had stood, a threatening ring, around Geoffrey
Greygown’s boy-heir had been successfully dealt with in some
way or other, till the little Marchland had grown to be a
power in the realm second only to Normandy and perhaps
to Aquitaine; and before Fulk’s reign closed, even Aquitaine,
the only one of Anjou’s immediate neighbours which had not
had to bow before him, fell prostrate at the feet of his son.
Fulk’s last years were to be years of peace. Only once
again did he take part in the general affairs of the French
kingdom; and then, as ever, his action was in strict accord
with the policy which he had begun and which his descendants
followed consistently down to the time of Henry Fitz-Empress:
a policy of steady loyalty to the lawful authority
of the French Crown, against which the counts of Blois lived
in perpetual opposition. After Robert’s death, in 1031,
Fulk appeared in the unexpected character of peace-maker
between Queen Constance and her son, the young King
Henry, whom she was trying to oust from his throne;<a id="Anchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 359.">[359]</a> and
he afterwards accompanied Henry on an expedition to dislodge
Odo of Champagne from Sens, which however succeeded
no better than the attempt once made by Odo and
Henry to dislodge Fulk himself from Amboise.<a id="Anchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 360.">[360]</a> But peace<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
or war, it mattered not to the Black Count; he was never
at a loss for work. When there was no enemy to fight or
to outwit, his versatile energies flung themselves just as
readily into the encouragement of piety or the improvement
and embellishment of his capital. Over the black bastions
of the castle with which the French King Philip Augustus,
when he had wrested Angers from a degenerate descendant
of its ancient counts, found it needful to secure his hold on
“this contemptuous city,” there still looks out upon the river
a fragment of a ruined hall, chiefly of red flintstone; it is the
sole remains of the dwelling-place of Fulk Nerra—in all
likelihood, his own work.<a id="Anchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 361.">[361]</a> A poetic legend shows him to us
for once quietly at home, standing in that hall and gazing at
the view from its windows. At his feet flowed the purple
Mayenne between its flat but green meadows—for the great
suburb beyond the river did not yet exist—winding down
beneath a bridge of his own building to join the Loire
beyond the rising hills to the south-west. His eyes, keen as
those of the “Falcon” whose name he bore, reached across
river and meadow to the slope of a hill directly opposite
him, where he descried a dove flying to and fro, picking up
fragments of earth and depositing them in a cavity which it
seemed to be trying to fill. Struck by the bird’s action, he
carefully marked the spot, and the work of the dove was
made the foundation-stone of a great abbey in honour of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Nicolas, which he had vowed to build as a thank-offering for
deliverance from a storm at sea on his return from his
second pilgrimage.<a id="Anchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 362.">[362]</a> This abbey, with a nunnery founded near
it eight years later—in 1128—by his countess Hildegard, on
the site of an ancient church dedicated to our Lady of
Charity,<a id="Anchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 363.">[363]</a> became the nucleus round which gathered in after-years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
a suburb known as Ronceray, scarcely less important
than the city itself. These tranquil home-occupations, however,
could not long satisfy the restless temper of Fulk.
The irresistible charm exercised by the Holy Land over so
many of the more imaginative spirits of the age drew him to
revisit it in 1035. One interesting event of the journey is
recorded: his meeting at Constantinople with Duke Robert
of Normandy, father of William the Conqueror.<a id="Anchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 364.">[364]</a> The old
and the young penitent completed their pilgrimage together;
but only the former lived to see his home again; and when
he reached it, he found the gates of Angers shut in his face
by his own son. The rebellion was soon quelled. Saddled
and bridled like a beast of burthen, Geoffrey came crawling
to his father’s feet. “Conquered art thou—conquered, conquered!”
shouted the old count, kicking his prostrate son.
“Aye, conquered by thee, for thou art my father; but
unconquered by all beside!” The spirited answer touched
Fulk’s paternal pride, and Geoffrey arose forgiven.<a id="Anchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 365.">[365]</a> The
power which he had thus undutifully tried to usurp was
soon to be his by right; not, however, till the Black Count
had given one last proof that neither his hand nor his brain
had yet forgotten its cunning. Odo of Champagne had long
ago left Touraine to its fate, and for the last four years he
had been absorbed in a visionary attempt to wrest from the
Emperor Conrad <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, first the kingdom of Burgundy, then
that of Italy, and at last the imperial crown itself; while
Fulk’s conquests of the valleys of the Indre and the Cher
had been completed by the acquisition of Montbazon and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>-Aignan.<a id="Anchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 366.">[366]</a> When at the close of 1037 tidings came that
Odo had been defeated and slain in a battle with the
imperial forces at Bar, the Angevin at once laid siege to
Langeais, and took it.<a id="Anchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 367.">[367]</a> One more stronghold still remained
to be won in the valley of the Vienne. From the right
bank of the little river, winding down silvery-blue between
soft green meadows to join the Loire beyond the circle of
the distant hills to the north-west, the mighty steep of
Chinon rises abruptly, as an old writer says, “straight up to
heaven”; range upon range of narrow streets climb like the
steps of a terrace up its rocky sides; acacias wave their
bright foliage from every nook; and on the crest of the
ridge a long line of white ruins, the remains of a stately
castle, stand out against the sky. A dense woodland of
oaks and larches and firs, stretching north-eastward almost
to the valley of the Indre, and crowded with game of every
kind, formed probably no small part of the attractions which
were to make Chinon the favourite retreat of Fulk Nerra’s
greatest descendant. In those ruined halls, where a rich
growth of moss and creepers has replaced the tapestried
hangings, earlier and later memories—memories of the Black
Count or of the Maid of Orleans—seem to an English
visitor only to flit like shadows around the death-bed of
Henry Fitz-Empress. But it was Fulk who won Chinon for
the Angevins. The persuasion of his tongue, as keen as his
sword, sufficed now to gain its surrender.<a id="Anchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 368.">[368]</a> The Great
Builder’s work was all but finished; only the keystone
remained to be dropped into its place. Tours itself stood
out alone against the conqueror of Touraine. One more
blow, and the count of Anjou would be master of the whole
valley of the Loire from Amboise to the sea.</p>

A grotesque legend, which yet has a somewhat characteristic ring, was told of
the origin of this nunnery. Fulk one day, watching a potter at his work, was
seized with a desire to try his hand. He succeeded in producing a well-shaped
pan, which he carried home in triumph and gave to his wife, telling her
that it was made by the man whom she loved best. Hildegard, mistaking the
jest for a serious charge, vowed to disprove it at once by undergoing the ordeal
of water, and flung herself out of the window and into the river, before her
husband could stop her. The spot where she came to land was marked by
the abbey of our Lady
    (<cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Revue <abbr title="Historique">hist.</abbr> de l’Anjou</i>, as above, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 54, 55, and note

    <cite>Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglises</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 279 note</cite>.) Its later name of “Ronceray” was
derived from a bramble-bush (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ronce</i>) which forced its way through the pavement
of the choir, despite all attempts to uproot it. This however was in the sixteenth
century.

<p>Strangely, yet characteristically, that final blow Fulk
left to be struck by his successor. As his life drew to its
close the ghostly terrors of his youth came back to him with
redoubled force; and the world which had marvelled at his
exploits and his crimes marvelled no less at his last penance.
For the fourth time he went out to Jerusalem, and there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
caused two servants, bound by an oath to do whatsoever he
should bid them, to drag him round the Holy City in the
sight of all the Turks, one holding him by a halter round his
neck, the other scourging his naked back, while he cried
aloud for Heaven’s mercy on his soul as a perjured and
miserable sinner.<a id="Anchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 369.">[369]</a> He made his way homeward as far as
Metz.<a id="Anchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 370.">[370]</a> There, on June 21st, 1040, the Black Count’s soul
passed away;<a id="Anchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 371.">[371]</a> and his body was embalmed, carried home
to Beaulieu, and buried in the chapter-house of the abbey
which had been the monument of his earliest pilgrimage, the
first-fruits of his youthful devotion and daring.<a id="Anchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 372.">[372]</a></p>

From the last
word one would imagine this could only mean Metz in Lorraine; but there is
another Metz in the Gâtinais; and although it is, and clearly always has been,
an insignificant little town, quite undeserving the title of “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">urbs</span>,” it seems more
likely than its greater namesake to be the place really meant. For Metz in
Lorraine would be completely out of the way of a traveller from Palestine to
Anjou, while Metz in the Gâtinais was not merely close to Fulk’s home, but was
actually in the territory of his own son-in-law (of whom we shall hear again later).
It would be as natural for him to stop there on his way as it would be unnatural
for him to fetch a compass through the remote dominions of the duke of Lorraine;
and, on the other hand, the place is so insignificant that a careless and ignorant
writer, such as John of Marmoutier, even though dwelling at no great distance,
might easily forget its existence.

<p>From Beaulieu, at least, he had deserved nothing but
gratitude, and Beaulieu never forgot the debt. For seven
centuries the anniversary of his death was solemnly observed
in the abbey; so was that of his widow, who as a
bride had helped to the dedication of the church, and who
now, following her husband’s last steps, went out to die at
Jerusalem.<a id="Anchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 373.">[373]</a> For seven centuries, as the monks gathered in
the church to keep their yearly festival in honour of his gift,
the fragment of sacred stone, they read over in the office of
the day the story of his pilgrimage, and chanted the praise
of his pious theft.<a id="Anchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 374.">[374]</a> Next to that trophy, his tomb was their
pride; it vanished in the general wreck of 1793; but research
within the last few years has happily succeeded in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
bringing the Black Count’s earthly resting-place to light once
more.<a id="Anchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 375.">[375]</a> But it was not Beaulieu alone that kept his memory
green. His own little Angevin marchland, his fairer conquest
Touraine, are sown thick with memorials of him. So strong
was the impression made by his activity in one direction
that after-generations have persisted in attributing to him
almost every important architectural work in his dominions,
and transferred the credit of several constructions even of
Henry Fitz-Empress to the first “great builder” of Anjou,
who was believed to have had command over more than mortal
artificers. Popular imagination, with its unerring instinct,
rightly seized upon the Black Count as the embodiment of
Angevin glory and greatness. The credit of the astute
politician, the valiant warrior, the consummate general, the
strenuous ruler—all this is his due, and something more;
the credit of having, by the initiative force of genius, launched
Anjou upon her career with an impetus such as no opposing
power could thenceforth avail to check. One is tempted to
wonder how far into the future of his house those keen eyes
of the Black Falcon really saw; whether he saw it or not,
that future was in a great measure of his own making; for
his fifty-three years of work and warfare had been spent in
settling the question on which that future depended—the
question whether Anjou or Blois was to be the chief power
of central Gaul. When his place was taken by Geoffrey
Martel, there could no longer be any doubt of the answer.</p>

<p>The new count of Anjou began his reign in circumstances
very unlike those of his father half a century before.
Not only had Fulk wholly changed the political position of
Anjou, but Geoffrey’s own position as an individual was
totally different. He was no untried boy, left to fight his
own way with no weapons save the endowments which
nature had given him; he was a full-grown man, trained in
the school of Fulk Nerra, and already experienced in
politics and war. In his own day Geoffrey Martel was looked
up to with as much respect as his father, and with even more
dread. His career is an illustration of the saying that
nothing succeeds like success. Till he came into collision<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
with the duke of Normandy, he carried all before him like
chaff before the wind. He crushed Aquitaine; he won Tours;
he won Le Mans. It was no wonder if he delighted to commemorate
in the surname of Martel, “the Hammer,” the victorious
blows which laid opponent after opponent at the feet of the
blacksmith’s foster-son.<a id="Anchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 376.">[376]</a> But Geoffrey was not the artificer
of his own fortune. He owed his pre-eminence among the
great vassals of the Crown to his extended possessions and
his military reputation; he owed his extended possessions
more to his father’s labours and to a series of favourable
accidents than to his own qualities as a statesman; and he
owed his military reputation—as one writer who understood
the Angevins thoroughly has very plainly hinted—more to
luck than to real generalship.<a id="Anchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 377.">[377]</a> Geoffrey stands at a disadvantage
thus far, that in contemplating him one cannot avoid
two very trying comparisons. It was as unlucky for his
after-fame as it was lucky for his material prosperity that he
was the son of Fulk the Black; it was unlucky for him in
every way that he was the rival of William the Conqueror.
Neither as a statesman, a ruler, a strategist, or a man was
Geoffrey equal to his father. As a statesman he showed no
very lofty capacity; his designs on Aquitaine, sweeping but
pointless, came to nothing in the end: and with regard to
Touraine and Maine, politically, he had little to do but to
reap the fruit of Fulk’s labours and use the advantages which
the favour of the king in one case, the rashness of the
bishop in the other, and the weakness of the rival count in
both, threw absolutely into his hands. As a ruler he seems
to have been looked up to with simple dread; there is little
trace of the intense personal following which others of his
race knew so well how to inspire;<a id="Anchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 378.">[378]</a> the first time he was intrusted
with the government of Anjou his harshness and
oppression roused the indignation alike of his subjects and of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
his father; his neighbours looked on him to the last as a
tyrant,<a id="Anchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 379.">[379]</a> and his own people seem to have feared far more
than they loved him. As a strategist there is really no
proof that he possessed any such overwhelming superiority
as he himself boasted, and as others were led to believe.
His two great victories, at Montcontour and Montlouis,
dazzled the world because the one was gained over a prince
who by the tradition of ages counted as the first potentate
in the realm after the duke of Normandy, and the
other led to the acquisition of Tours; but the capture of
William of Aquitaine was really nothing more than the
fortune of war; while in the case of the victory over
Theobald of Blois at Montlouis, a considerable part of the
credit is due to Geoffrey’s lieutenant Lisoy of Amboise; and
moreover, to have beaten the successor of Odo <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> is after all
no very wonderful achievement for the successor of Fulk the
Black. Twice in his life Geoffrey met his master. The
first time he owned it himself as he lay at his father’s
feet. The second time he evaded the risk of open defeat by
a tacit withdrawal far more shameful in a moral point of
view. It is small blame to Geoffrey Martel that he was no
match for William the Conqueror. Had he, in honest consciousness
of his inferiority, done his best to avoid a collision,
and when it became inevitable stood to face the consequences
like a man, it would have been small shame to him
to be defeated by the future victor of Senlac. The real
shame is that after courting an encounter and loudly boasting
of his desire to break a lance with William, when the opportunity
was given him he silently declined to use it. It was
but a mean pride and a poor courage that looked upon
defeat in fair fight as an unbearable humiliation, and could
not feel the deeper moral humiliation of shrinking from the
mere chance of that defeat. And it is just this bluntness of
feeling, this callousness to everything not visible and tangible
to outward sense, which sets Geoffrey as a man far below
his father. There is in Fulk a living warmth, a quickness of
susceptibility, which breaks out in all sorts of shapes, good
and bad, in all the stories of the Black Count, but which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
seems wholly lacking in Geoffrey. Fulk “sinned bravely,”
ardently, impulsively; Geoffrey sinned meanly, coldly,
heartlessly. His was altogether a coarser, lower nature.
Fulk was truly the falcon that wheels its swift and lofty
flight ever closer and closer above the doomed quarry till it
strikes it down irresistibly with one unerring swoop. Geoffrey
rightly thought himself better represented by the crashing
blows of the insensible sledge-hammer.</p>

<p>Geoffrey had been an independent ruler in a small sphere
for nearly ten years before his father’s death. In 1030 or
1031 he became master of the little county of Vendôme by
purchase from his half-sister Adela, the only child of Fulk’s
ill-starred first marriage, and the heiress of her maternal
grandfather Count Burchard. After doing homage to King
Henry for the fief, Geoffrey’s first act was to found in the
capital of his new dominions an abbey dedicated to the
Holy Trinity.<a id="Anchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 380.">[380]</a> The appointment of an abbot proved the
occasion for the first recorded outbreak of that latent discord
between Fulk and his heir which, as we have seen, culminated
at last in open war. A monk named Reginald had
just been sent at Fulk’s request from the great abbey of
Marmoutier near Tours, to take the place of Baldwin, abbot
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Nicolas at Angers, who had fled to bury himself in a
hermitage. Before the day came for Reginald’s ordination,
however, he deserted to a younger patron, and accepted the
abbotship of Geoffrey’s newly-founded abbey at Vendôme.
Fulk, thus disappointed by two abbots in succession, “flew,”
as he himself said, “into a mighty rage,” summarily ordered
the whole colony of monks whom he had brought from
Marmoutier to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Nicolas back to their parent monastery,
and replaced them with some of the brethren of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Aubin’s
at Angers, with Hilduin, prior of that convent, as their
head.<a id="Anchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 381.">[381]</a> Fulk’s wrath seems to have been directed against
the monks rather than against his son; but the incident
serves as an illustration of the tendency to opposition that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
was springing up in Geoffrey’s mind. The quiet, waiting
policy of Fulk’s latter years was evidently irksome to the
young man’s impatient spirit, and he chose to strike out a
path for himself in a direction which, it is not surprising to
learn, did not please the old count. The only one of his
neighbours with whom Fulk seems to have been always on
peaceable terms was the count of Poitou. William Fierabras,
the count from whom Geoffrey Greygown had wrested
Loudun, died about two years after the second battle of
Conquereux.<a id="Anchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 382.">[382]</a> His wife was a daughter of Theobald the
Trickster,<a id="Anchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 383.">[383]</a> and his son and successor was therefore first cousin
to Odo <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> of Blois; but William <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr>—whom Aquitaine
reckoned as her “William the Great”—seems to have had
little in common with his erratic kinsman, and to have
always, on the other hand, maintained a friendly understanding
with Anjou. Like Odo, he once received an offer
of the crown of Italy; Fulk appears in the negotiations as
the friendly advocate of the duke’s interests with King
Robert,<a id="Anchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 384.">[384]</a> and though the project came to nothing, it may
have been in return for Fulk’s good offices on this occasion
that William bestowed on him the investiture of Saintes, a
gift which was to form the pretext for more than one war
between their descendants. On January 31st, 1029,
William died,<a id="Anchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 385.">[385]</a> leaving as his successor a son who bore the
same name, and whose mother seems to have been a sister
of Queen Constance.<a id="Anchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 386.">[386]</a> It was this new duke of Aquitaine,
known as William the Fat, whom Geoffrey Martel selected
as the first victim of his heavy hand. An Angevin story
attributes the origin of the war to a dispute about Saintes
or Saintonge,<a id="Anchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 387.">[387]</a> but it will not bear examination. Geoffrey
Martel simply trod in the steps of Geoffrey Greygown, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
with more marked success. In the autumn of 1033 he
started on an expedition against the duke of Aquitaine;
William encountered him on September 20th in a pitched
battle near the abbey of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Jouin-de-Marne, not far from
Montcontour in Poitou; the Poitevins were defeated, partly,
it seems, through treason in their own ranks, and their duke
was taken prisoner.<a id="Anchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 388.">[388]</a> For three years the duke of Aquitaine,
the second great feudatary of the realm, was kept in a
dungeon by the count of Vendôme;<a id="Anchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 389.">[389]</a> not till the whole
district of Saintonge<a id="Anchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 390.">[390]</a> and several important towns were
ceded to Geoffrey, and an annual tribute promised, would
he release his captive. From the execution of the last
humiliating condition William was delivered by death; the
cruel treatment he had suffered in prison had done its work;
Geoffrey had exacted the ransom for his prisoner just in
time, and sent him home only to die three days after his
liberation.<a id="Anchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 391.">[391]</a></p>

<p>Then Geoffrey threw off the mask. William had no
children; his next heir was his half-brother Odo, the son of
his father’s second marriage with Brisca, heiress of Gascony.<a id="Anchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 392.">[392]</a>
But after Brisca’s death, William the Great had married a
third wife, whom he had left a still young widow with three
little children. Before William the Fat had been many
months dead, his stepmother the widowed Countess Agnes
gave her hand to Geoffrey of Vendôme.<a id="Anchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 393.">[393]</a> Geoffrey’s motive<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
is plain; he sought to prevent the union of Poitou and
Gascony and to get the former practically into his own
hands as stepfather and guardian to the young sons of
Agnes. But in Anjou the wedding gave great scandal;
Geoffrey and Agnes were denounced in the harshest terms
as too near akin to marry.<a id="Anchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 394.">[394]</a> They seem in fact to have been,
by the reckoning of the canon law, cousins in the third
degree, as being, one a grandson, the other a great-granddaughter
of Adela of Chalon, the second wife of Geoffrey
Greygown.<a id="Anchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 395.">[395]</a> At any rate they were looked upon as sinners,
and by no one more than the bridegroom’s father. The
whole scheme of Geoffrey’s meddlings in Aquitaine was
repugnant to Fulk Nerra’s policy; he looked to his son to
complete his own labours in Touraine and Maine, and it was
no good omen for the fulfilment of his hopes when Geoffrey
thus turned his back upon his appointed work for the love
of Countess Agnes or of her late husband’s possessions. The
capture of William the Fat had been the signal for the first
outbreak of a “more than civil war” between father and
son;<a id="Anchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 396.">[396]</a> Geoffrey’s misconduct during his regency in Anjou
brought matters to the crisis which ended in his first and
last public defeat. Nevertheless he obstinately pursued his
projects. The Poitevins, by the death of their count, were
left, as their own chronicler says, “as sheep having no
shepherd”; there was a party among them ready to support
the claims of Agnes’s sons against their elder half-brother
Odo of Gascony; and one of the leaders of this
party, William of Parthenay, built with Angevin help a
fortress at Germont in which he held out successfully against
the besieging forces of Odo. The count of Gascony then
proceeded to Mausé, another stronghold of his enemies, and
in assaulting this place he was slain.<a id="Anchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 397.">[397]</a> He left no children;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
the elder of Geoffrey Martel’s stepsons was now therefore
heir to Poitou. The boys were twins; the third child of
Agnes was a girl, who bore her mother’s name, and for
whom her mother and stepfather contrived in 1043 to
arrange a marriage with no less important a personage than
the Emperor Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>,<a id="Anchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 398.">[398]</a> whose first wife had been a
daughter of Cnut. It was not till the year after this
imperial wedding that the troubled affairs of Aquitaine were
definitely settled. In 1044 Countess Agnes came to Poitiers
accompanied by her two sons, Peter and Geoffrey, and her
husband, their stepfather, Geoffrey Martel; there they held
with the chief nobles of Poitou a council at which Peter, or
William as he was thenceforth called, was solemnly ordained
as duke of Aquitaine, and his brother sent into Gascony to
become its count.<a id="Anchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 399.">[399]</a> Agnes at least must now have attained
her object; whether Geoffrey Martel was equally satisfied
with the result of his schemes may be a question, for we do
not clearly know how wide the range of those schemes really
was. If, as seems likely, they included the hope of acquiring
a lasting hold over Aquitaine, then their issue was a
failure. By the victory of Montcontour Geoffrey had gained
for himself at one blow a great military reputation; but for
Anjou the only solid gain was the acquisition of Saintonge,
and this, like some of the outlying possessions of the house
of Blois, soon proved more trouble than profit. If Martel
expected that his stepsons would hold themselves indebted
to him for their coronets and remain his grateful and dutiful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177">177</a></span>
miscalculation. The marriage of a duchess-dowager of
Aquitaine with Geoffrey Martel naturally suggests thoughts
of the marriage of a duchess-regnant with a later count of
Anjou; but the resemblance between the two cases is of
the most superficial kind; the earlier connexion between
Anjou and Aquitaine did little or nothing to pave the way
for their later union. Geoffrey himself, indeed, had already
discovered that although the count of Vendôme might go
seeking adventures in the south, the duties and the interests
of the count of Anjou still lay to the north, or at the
utmost no farther away than the banks of the great frontier-river.</p>

<p>The visions of empire to which Odo of Champagne had
sacrificed the latter years of his life had perished with him
on the field of Bar. Not a foot of land outside the limits of
the kingdom of France had he left to his heirs. He had
two sons, Theobald and Stephen, whose very names seemed
to mark out their destined shares in his dominions. Stephen,
the younger, became count of Champagne; to Theobald,
the elder, fell the original territories of his house—Blois,
Chartres and Tours.<a id="Anchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 400.">[400]</a> Theobald’s heritage however was
shorn of its fairest portion. The county of Tours now comprised
little more than the capital; all Touraine south of the
Loire—by far the most fertile and valuable half—was in the
power of the Angevin; Tours itself, once a secure central
post, had become a closely threatened border-city. Theobald’s
first duty was to protect it, but it seems to have been
the last thing he thought of. Odo’s sons had inherited all
his wrongheadedness without his quickness of thought and
action. Shut in as they were on all sides by powerful foes,
the two young men began their career by rebelling after the
manner of their forefathers;<a id="Anchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 401.">[401]</a> and the king’s youngest
brother Odo was lured, by a promise of dethroning Henry
in his favour, into joining in their rebellion. Odo, a youth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178">178</a></span>
of weak intellect, was in himself no very formidable person,
but he might for the very same reason become a dangerous
tool in the hands of his fellow-conspirators; and a rebellious
coalition of Blois and Champagne threatened to be a serious
difficulty for the king at a moment when there was scarcely
one of the great feudataries on whom he could reckon for
support. The death of Duke Robert of Normandy had
plunged his duchy into confusion and deprived Henry of all
chance of help in the quarter which had hitherto been his
chief source of strength. The county of Burgundy was
governed by the king’s brother Robert, who had with difficulty
been induced to accept it as compensation for the
failure of his hopes of the crown. Flanders and Britanny
were always indifferent to the troubles and necessities of the
king; the count of Vermandois was a kinsman and ally of
Champagne; Aquitaine was as powerless as Normandy. The
one vassal to whom Henry could look for aid was the count
of Anjou. Had the rebels possessed sense and spirit they
might have given Henry quite as much trouble as their
father had given Robert; but they seem to have had no
well-concerted plan; each acted independently, and each
was crushed singly. Young Odo, their puppet pretender,
was easily caught and imprisoned at Orléans; Stephen
of Champagne was defeated in a pitched battle by the
king himself;<a id="Anchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 402.">[402]</a> Theobald of Blois was left to be dealt
with by other hands. With a master-stroke of policy,
Henry proclaimed the city of Tours forfeit by Theobald’s
rebellion, and granted its investiture to the count of
Anjou.<a id="Anchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 403.">[403]</a></p>

<p>To understand the full importance of this grant and of
the war which followed it, we must know something of the
history of Tours and of the peculiar feelings and interests
attached to it. The origin of Tours as a city dates from
the time of the Roman empire, when it appears under the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179">179</a></span>
name of Cæsarodunum.<a id="Anchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 404.">[404]</a> The Roman <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">castrum</i> was built in
a broad, shallow sort of basin, watered on the north by the
Loire, on the south by the Cher; it probably occupied the
site of some village of those Turones or Turoni, who play a
part in the Gallic wars of Cæsar,<a id="Anchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 405.">[405]</a> and whose name in the
end superseded that which the place received from its conqueror.
The “city of the Turones” became the central
point of a network of roads connecting it with Poitiers,
Chartres, Bourges, Orléans, Le Mans and Angers;<a id="Anchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 406.">[406]</a> and
owing to the convenience of its situation for military and
administrative purposes it was made the capital of the Third
Lyonnese province.<a id="Anchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 407.">[407]</a> But its hold on the minds of men was
due to another gift of Rome, more precious than roads or
fortifications or even political traditions. It was the holy
city of Gaul, the cradle of Gaulish Christianity. Its first
bishop, Gatian, was one of seven missionaries sent out from
Rome to evangelize the Gallic provinces in the days of the
Decian persecution.<a id="Anchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 408.">[408]</a> <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Gatian’s episcopate of half a century
fell in one of the most distracted periods of the Empire;
after his death the Church which he had planted
remained untended for nearly forty years, and it was not till
after the death of Constantine that Tours received her
second bishop in the person of Lidorius, one of her own
sons, who laid the foundations of a cathedral church.<a id="Anchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 409.">[409]</a> But
the fame of the two first bishops of Tours was completely
overshadowed by that of the third. The work of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Gatian
and <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Lidorius was confined to their own immediate flock;
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin was the apostle not only of Touraine but of all
central Gaul. Born at Sabaria<a id="Anchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 410.">[410]</a> in the Upper Pannonia, in
the reign of the first Christian Emperor, but of heathen
parents, Martin rose to high military distinction under the
Cæsar Julian, accompanied him into Gaul, and enjoyed his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180">180</a></span>
utmost esteem and regard till he forfeited them by renouncing
the standard of the eagles for that of the Cross. Neither
the wrath of his commander nor the entreaties of his fellow-soldiers,
by whom he was greatly beloved, availed to shake
his resolution; he fled to Poitiers, and there found a friend
and counsellor in the holy bishop Hilary, from whom he
received the minor orders. After braving toil and peril by
land and sea in a journey to his native country for the conversion
of his family, he returned to a life of seclusion in
Gaul, and acquired such a reputation for holiness that on the
death of Lidorius in 371 the people of Tours, in spite of his
strenuous resistance, actually forced him to become their
bishop.<a id="Anchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 411.">[411]</a> From that moment Tours became a mission-centre
whence the light of the faith spread with marvellous rapidity
over all the surrounding country. Anjou and all the neighbouring
lands owed their conversion to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin and the
missionaries sent out by him; everywhere paganism gave
way before his eloquent preaching, his dauntless courage, his
almost apostolic endowments—above all, perhaps, his good
example. He was looked upon as the Thaumaturgus of
Gaul, and countless legends were told of his wonder-working
powers; more famous than all of them is a story of the saint
in his soldier-days, when, Christian already in feeling though
not yet in profession, he stopped his horse one cold winter’s
night, drew his sword and cut his military cloak in halves to
share it with one whose necessity was greater than his own.
That night he dreamed that the Lord whom, not knowing,
he yet instinctively served, appeared to him wearing the half
cloak which he had thus given away; and it was this vision
which determined him to receive baptism.<a id="Anchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 412.">[412]</a> Amid all his
busy, active life he never lost the love of solitary contemplation
so characteristic of the early Christian missionaries.
His episcopal city lay on the south side of the Loire, but
had on the north or right bank a large suburb afterwards
known by the name of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Symphorian; beyond this, farther
to the eastward, the bishop found for himself a <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>“green
retreat,” which has scarcely yet lost its air of peaceful loneliness,
and which, before the suburb had spread to its present
extent, must have been an ideal spot for monastic retirement.
A little wooden cell with its back against the white
limestone rock which shelters the northern side of the basin
of Tours—an expanse of green solitude in front, stretching
down to the broad calm river—such was the nest which <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Martin built him in the wilderness; gathering round him a
little band of men likeminded with himself, he snatched
every spare moment from his episcopal cares to flee away
thither and be at rest;<a id="Anchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 413.">[413]</a> and the rock-hewn cells of the
brotherhood became the nucleus of a famous abbey, the
“Great Monastery,” as it was emphatically called—<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Majus
Monasterium</i>, Marmoutier. Another minster, of almost
greater fame, grew up over the saint’s burial place outside
the western wall of the city, on low-lying ground which,
before it was reclaimed by the energetic dyke-makers of the
ninth and tenth centuries, must have been not unfrequently
under water. It is within the episcopal city of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin,
in the writings of Bishop Gregory of Tours, that West-Frankish
history begins. An English student feels a nearer
interest in the abbey without the walls, remembering that
the abbot under whom it reached its highest glory and
became the very fount and source of all contemporary learning,
human and divine, was Alcuin of York.</p>

<p>When the great English scholar and the great Emperor
who had brought him into Gaul were gone, Tours underwent
her full share of suffering in the invasions of the northmen.
City and abbey became to the valley of the Loire something
like what Paris and <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Denis were to that of the Seine, the
chief bulwark against the fresh tide of heathen force which
threatened to sweep away the footsteps of saints and scholars.
Once, indeed, Tours had been in danger from heathens of
another sort, and a body of Saracens had been turned back
from her gates and destroyed by Charles Martel.<a id="Anchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 414.">[414]</a> There
was no Martel to save her from the northmen; her only<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182">182</a></span>
defence consisted in the valour of her citizens, and the fortifications
left to her by her Roman governors and carefully
strengthened by her Karolingian sovereigns.<a id="Anchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 415.">[415]</a> Over and over again the pirates were driven back from the walls of
Cæsarodunum; over and over again <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin’s Abbey was
burnt to the ground. For years the canons, who in Alcuin’s
days had taken the place of the original monks,<a id="Anchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 416.">[416]</a> lived in
constant fear of desecration befalling their patron’s body,
and carried it from place to place, like the body of our own
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Cuthbert, sometimes depositing it within the city walls,
sometimes removing it farther inland—once even to the far-off
Burgundian duchy—bringing it home whenever they
dared, or whenever they had a church fit to contain it. Two
of these “reversions”—one on December 13, 885, the other
on May 12, 919—were annually celebrated at Tours, in
addition to two other feasts of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin, his ordination on
July 4 and his “deposition” on November 11.<a id="Anchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 417.">[417]</a> In the
first reversion Ingelger, the founder of the Angevin house,
was said to have borne a prominent part. The story of the
second was afterwards superseded by a famous legend known
as that of the “subvention of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin.” Once, it was
said, when the citizens of Tours were sore pressed by the
besieging hosts of the northmen, they resolved to intrust
their cause to a heavenly champion, and brought out upon
the walls the corpse of the saint, which had been deposited
for safety within the city. The living heathen fled at once
before the dead saint; they were pursued by the triumphant
citizens, still carrying their patron in their midst, and utterly
routed at a spot which thence received the name of “<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Martin of the Battle.”<a id="Anchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 418.">[418]</a> This story seems to belong to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183">183</a></span>
siege of 903, when Marmoutier was destroyed, and the abbey
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin burnt to the ground for the third time. When
the canons again rebuilt it, they took the precaution of
encircling it with a wall, and procured from Charles the
Simple a charter which resulted in the creation of a new
fortified borough, exempt from the jurisdiction of both
bishop and count, and subject only to its own abbot—in other
words, to the duke of the French, who from the middle of
the eighth century always held <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in commendam</i> the abbey of
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin at Tours, as he did that of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Denis at Paris.<a id="Anchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 419.">[419]</a>
Thus, side by side with the old city of the Turones,
Cæsarodunum with its Roman walls, its count, its cathedral
and its archbishop, there arose the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Castrum Novum</span>,”
Châteauneuf, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Castellum <abbr title="Sancti">S.</abbr> Martini</span>,” Martinopolis as it is
sometimes called, with its own walled enclosure, its collegiate
church and its abbot-duke. The counts of Anjou, who
followed so steadily in the train of the ducal house, were
not blind to the means of gaining a footing in such tempting
neighbourhood to the walls of Tours; from an early period
they took care to connect themselves with the abbey of
which their patron was the head. The first count of Anjou
and his father play an important part in the legendary
history of the two great “reversions”; Fulk the Good is
almost more familiar to us as canon than as count, and the
stall next to that of the dean of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin’s, which he so
loved to occupy, whence he wrote his famous letter, and
where he saw his vision of the saint, seems to have become
hereditary among his descendants like the abbotship among
those of Hugh the Great. Good Canon Fulk prized it as a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184">184</a></span>
spiritual privilege; his successors probably looked upon it
rather in the light of a political wedge whereby they might
some day force an entrance into the greedily-coveted city
itself. Tours was the point towards which Fulk the Black had
worked steadily all his life long; and when he left his son
to complete his labours, that point was almost reached. But,
with her broad river and her Roman walls, Tours was still
hard to win. To block the river was impossible; to break
down the walls would need nothing less than a regular siege,
and one which could not fail to be long, tedious and costly.
Geoffrey seems to have delayed the task until by the king’s
grant of the investiture it became a point of honour as well
as a matter of the most pressing interest to make good the
claim thus placed in his hands.</p>

<p>He woke at once from his Aquitanian dreams, gathered
his forces, and led them out, probably not by the old Roman
road from Juliomagus to Cæsarodunum past the white steeps
of his father’s Montboyau, but by a safer though longer
route, passing along the southern bank of the Loire and
across the valleys of the Vienne and the Indre, to lay siege
to Tours. With the royal sanction to his enterprise he had
the great advantage of being able to use Châteauneuf as a
basis of operations. The monastery of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Julian, at the
north-east corner of the town, close against the city wall, was
especially convenient for attacking the latter; Geoffrey took
possession of it and used it accordingly.<a id="Anchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 420.">[420]</a> The city, however,
held out against him for a whole year, during which its inhabitants
seem to have been left by their count to defend
themselves as best they could. At last, in August 1044,
Theobald collected an army for its relief, in union with the
forces of Champagne under his brother Stephen.<a id="Anchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 421.">[421]</a> Geoffrey,
in expectation of this, had detached from his main force a
body of two hundred knights and fifteen hundred foot, whom
he posted at Amboise under Lisoy, to guard the road against
Theobald.<a id="Anchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 422.">[422]</a> The services of Lisoy were a special legacy from
Fulk the Black to his son. Of all Fulk’s adherents, none<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185">185</a></span>
had served him so intelligently and so devotedly as this
Cenomannian knight whom he had chosen to be the colleague
of the aged Sulpice in the defence of Amboise and Loches.
Fulk, when he felt his end approaching, had striven hard to
impress on his son the value of such a true and tried friend,
and at the same time to bind Lisoy yet more closely to him
by arranging his marriage with Hersendis, the niece and
heiress of Sulpice, whereby Lisoy came into possession of all
Sulpice’s estates at Loches and Amboise, including the famous
tower of stone.<a id="Anchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 423.">[423]</a> Lisoy proved as true to the new count as
to the old one. Theobald, not daring to come within reach
of Amboise, avoided the direct route from Blois to Tours
along the Loire,<a id="Anchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 424.">[424]</a> and took the road by Pontlevoy to Montrichard.
The chief force of Montrichard, with its commander
Roger, was no doubt with Geoffrey before Tours, so the
count of Blois pursued his way unmolested, plundering as he
went, down the valley of the Cher, till he pitched his tents
in the meadows of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>-Quentin opposite Bléré, and there
stayed a day and a night to rest.<a id="Anchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 425.">[425]</a> All his movements were
known to the watchful lord of Amboise; and as soon as
Lisoy had fully ascertained the numbers and plans of the
enemy, he hurried off to seek his count in the army before
Tours, and offer him some sound military advice. He represented
that it would be far better to raise the siege, join
the whole Angevin force with that which was already at
Amboise, and stake everything on a pitched battle. The
enemy might beat either Geoffrey or his lieutenant singly,
but united they would be irresistible; and whereas the siege
must be long and tedious, and its result uncertain, one
victory in the field would lay all Touraine at the victor’s
feet. Only let the count be quick and not suffer his foe to
catch him at unawares.<a id="Anchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 426.">[426]</a></p>

<p>Geoffrey, as he listened to this bold counsel, must have
been reminded of his father’s warning, that a true friend like
Lisoy was a surer source of strength than either hosts or
treasures.<a id="Anchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 427.">[427]</a> He took the advice, and while Lisoy returned<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
to Amboise to bring up his little force to the trysting-place
agreed upon between them, his count, after diligent prayers
and vows to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin, took the consecrated banner of the
abbey from its place above the shrine, affixed it to his own
spear, and rode forth with it at the head of all his troops to
do battle with Theobald.<a id="Anchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 428.">[428]</a> On the same day when Theobald
encamped opposite Bléré Geoffrey reached Montlouis, a hill
on the south bank of the Loire, about half way between
Tours and Amboise. Next morning the men of Blois
resumed their march; turning in a north-westerly direction
they were met at a place called Noit by the Angevins
coming down from Montlouis. The Hammer of Anjou,
ever foremost in fight, headed the attack on the enemy’s
centre; his faithful Lisoy came up, as he had promised, at
the head of his contingent, and threw himself on their right
wing.<a id="Anchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 429.">[429]</a> What followed scarcely deserved the name of a
battle. The army of the brother-counts seemed spell-bound,
and made no resistance at all; Stephen took to flight at
once and escaped with a few knights;<a id="Anchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 430.">[430]</a> the rest of the troops
of Blois and Champagne were utterly defeated and taken
prisoners almost in a body. The men of Amboise were hottest
in pursuit of the fugitives, and they won the great prize of the
day. They drove Theobald with some five or six hundred
knights into a wood called Braye, whence it was impossible
for horsemen to extricate themselves; and thus Lisoy had
the honour of bringing the count of Blois a captive to the
feet of Geoffrey Martel.<a id="Anchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 431.">[431]</a> No one at the time doubted that
the Angevins owed their easy victory to the saint whose
standard they were following. The few soldiers of Theobald
who escaped declared that they had seen Geoffrey’s troops all
clad in shining white raiment, and fled in horror, believing
themselves to be fighting against the hosts of Heaven.<a id="Anchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 432.">[432]</a>
The village near which the fight took place was called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187">187</a></span>
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">burgum <abbr title="Sancti">S.</abbr> Martini Belli</span>”<a id="Anchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 433.">[433]</a>—<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin of the Battle, a
name derived from the “subvention of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin,” supposed
to have occurred at the same place two hundred years before.
Most curiously, neither the well-known legend of the saint’s
triumph over the northmen nor the fame of Geoffrey’s
triumph over the count of Blois availed to fix in popular
memory the true meaning of the name. While the English
“Place of Battle” at Senlac has long forgotten its dedication
to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin, its namesake in Touraine has forgotten both
its battles and become “<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>-Martin-le-Beau.”</p>

<p>With very little bloodshed, the Angevins had gained
over a thousand prisoners.<a id="Anchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 434.">[434]</a> The most valuable of them all
was put in ward at Loches;<a id="Anchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 435.">[435]</a> but he took care not to stay
there long. Theobald took warning by the fate of William
of Aquitaine;<a id="Anchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 436.">[436]</a> he had no mind to run the risk of dying in
prison, and held his person far dearer than his property.<a id="Anchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 437.">[437]</a>
Three days after his capture, finding that no amount of
silver or gold would avail to purchase his release, he yielded
the only ransom which Geoffrey would accept: the city of
Tours and the whole county of Touraine.<a id="Anchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 438.">[438]</a> A nominal
overlordship over the ceded territory was reserved to Theobald,
and Geoffrey had to go through the formality of doing
homage for it to him.<a id="Anchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 439.">[439]</a> When the substance was securely
his own, the count of Anjou could well afford to leave to
his vanquished rival the shadowy consolation of an empty
ceremony. Moreover, the circumstances of the whole transaction
and the account of King Henry’s grant to Geoffrey
clearly imply that Theobald’s rights over the most important
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188">188</a></span>
point of all, the capital itself, were considered as entirely
forfeited by his rebellion, so that with regard to the city of
Tours Geoffrey stepped into the exact place of its former
counts, holding it directly of the king alone.</p>

<p>The acquisition of Tours closes the second stage in the
career of the house of Anjou. Looked at from a strictly
Angevin point of view, the period just passed through,
although in one sense only preliminary, is the most important
of all, for it is that on which depended all the later growth,
nay, almost the very existence of Anjou. Had the counts
of Blois proved too strong for her in these her early years,
she would have been swallowed up altogether; had they
merely proved themselves her equals, the two states so
closely bound together would have neutralized each other
so that neither of them could have risen to any commanding
eminence; till one or the other should sweep its rival out of
its path, both must be impeded in their developement. At
the opening of the struggle, in Fulk Nerra’s youth, Blois was
distinctly in the ascendant, and the chances of independent
existence for the little Marchland hung solely on the courage
and statesmanship of its count. His dauntless genius,
helped by Odo’s folly, saved Anjou and turned the tide
completely in its favour. The treaty sworn, four years after
Fulk’s death, in his great castle by the Indre, was the
crowning of his life’s work, and left his son absolutely without
a rival till he chose to seek one beyond the debateable
ground of Maine. The long struggle of Fulk and Odo,
completed by Geoffrey and Theobald, had made a clear field
for the future struggles of Geoffrey and William, of Fulk <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr>
and Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, and at last—by a strange turn of fate—for a
renewal of the old feud with the house of Blois itself, in a
new form and for a far higher stake, in the struggle of
Stephen and Henry Fitz-Empress for the English crown.</p>

<span class="note_title">THE SIEGE OF MELUN.</span></h4>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>

<p>The fullest account of this Melun affair is in
    <cite>Richer, <abbr title="book 4">l. iv.</abbr> <abbr title="chapters">cc.</abbr> 74–78</cite>.
Briefly, it comes to this: Odo (described simply by his name,
without title of any kind) “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">rerum suarum augmentum querebat</span>,”
and especially the castle of Melun, partly for the convenience of
getting troops across the Seine, and partly because it had formerly
belonged to his grandfather and was now in the hands, not of the
king, but of “another” (not named). He managed to corrupt the
officer in command and to obtain possession of the place. As soon
as the kings (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">reges</i>) heard of it, they gathered their forces to besiege
him there: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et quia castrum circumfluente Sequanâ ambiebatur,
ipsi in litore primo castra disponunt; in ulteriore, accitas piratarum
acies ordinant</span>.” These “pirates” furnished a fleet which blockaded
the place, and finally discovered a secret entrance whereby they got
into the town, surprised the castle, and compelled it to surrender to
the king (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">regi</i>).</p>

<p>2. William of Jumièges
    (<cite><abbr title="book 5">l. v.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 14, Duchesne, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Historiae Normannorum Scriptores">Hist. Norm. Scriptt.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 255</cite>) tells the story more briefly, but to exactly the same
effect. He mentions however only <em>one</em> king: he supplies the name
of the “other man” who held Melun—viz. Burchard: he clearly
implies that “Odo” is Odo <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> of Blois (of whose doings with Normandy
he has just given an account in
    <cite><abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 12, <i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 254</cite>); and, of
course, he gives the “pirates” their proper name of Normans, and
puts them under their proper leader, Duke Richard [the Good].</p>

<p>3. Hugh of Fleury tells the same tale very concisely, but with
all the names, and gives a date, <abbr title="year">a.</abbr> 999
    (<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Rerum Gallicarum Scriptores">Rer. Gall. Scriptt.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 10">vol. x.</abbr>
<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 220, 221</cite>). (He is copied by the
    <cite><abbr title="Chronica Sancti Petri Senonensis" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chron. S. Petr. Senon.</abbr>, <i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr>
222.</cite>)</p>

<p>4. The
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Abbreviato Gestorum Franciæ Regum</i></cite>
tells the same, but
gives no date beyond “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">eo tempore</span>,” coming just after Hugh Capet’s
death
    (<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Rerum Gallicarum Scriptores">Rer. Gall. Scriptt.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 10">vol. x.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 227</cite>).</p>

<p>5. The
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vita Burchardi Comitis</i></cite>
gives no dates, does not identify
Odo, and does not mention the Normans, but makes Burchard himself
the chief actor in the regaining of the place
    (<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Rerum Gallicarum Scriptores">Rer. Gall. Scriptt.</abbr></i>,
<abbr title="volume 10">vol. x.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 354, 355</cite>.
In
    <cite><abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 350, note <i>a</i></cite>,
the editor makes Burchard
a son of Fulk the Good; but he gives no authority, and I can find
none).</p>

<p>6. The Angevins have a version of their own. In the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta
<abbr title="Consulum">Cons.</abbr></i> (Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 76, 77)</cite>
the captor of Melun is
“Herbert count of Troyes”; in
    <cite>Hugh of Clères (<i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 388)</cite>
he has
the same title but no name, and neither has the king, who in the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta</i></cite>
is called Robert. The victim is not named at all; but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190">190</a></span>
hero who plays a part equivalent to that of the Normans in the
other versions is Geoffrey Greygown.</p>

<p>The main question is the date. One authority—Hugh of Fleury—gives
it distinctly as 999. <abbr title="William of Jumièges">Will. Jumièges</abbr> clearly identifies the
Odo in question as Odo <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> Now Odo <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> was not count till 1004;
but his father died in 995, so William may have given him the title
by anticipation at any time after that date. The
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Abbreviato Gestorum Franciæ Regum">Abbr. Gest. Franc.
Reg.</abbr></i></cite>
would seem to place it thereabouts, as its note of time is “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">eo
tempore</span>” in reference to Hugh Capet’s death (which occurred in
October 996). On the other hand, Richer speaks of “the <em>kings</em>”
in the plural; from which Kalckstein, Waitz and Luchaire
    (<cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Histoire">Hist.</abbr> des
Institutions monarchiques de la France</i>, <abbr title="volume 2">vol. ii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 7, note 1</cite>) conclude
that it is Odo <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> who is concerned, and they date the affair 991.
Why they fix upon this year, in defiance of both William of Jumièges
and Hugh of Fleury, I cannot see. <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr> d’Arbois de Jubainville
    (<cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes de Champagne</i>, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 196</cite>) adopts Hugh’s date, 999. Is
it not possible, however, from a comparison of the other authorities,
that the right year is 996, just before Hugh’s death, or even that he
died while the siege was in progress? for it is to be noticed that
Richer mentions only <em>one</em> king at the surrender. Richer has made
such a confusion about these Odos and their doings that it is hardly
fair to set him up as an infallible authority on the subject against
such writers as Hugh of Fleury and William of Jumièges. Anyhow,
the Angevin story cannot stand against any of them.</p>

<span class="note_title">THE PARENTS OF QUEEN CONSTANCE.</span></h4>

<p>The parentage of Constance requires some notice here, as she is
usually called either a niece or a cousin of Fulk Nerra. The one
point on which all authorities are agreed is that her father’s name
was William. It was long disputed whether he was William <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>
(Taillefer) count of Toulouse or William <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> count of Arles and Provence.
<abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Mabille, in a note to the latest edition of Vic and
Vaissète’s
    <cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Histoire">Hist.</abbr> du Languedoc</i></cite>
(Toulouse, 1872), <abbr title="volume 4">vol. iv.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 157–161,
has made it clear that he was William of Arles; this conclusion is
adopted by <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr> Luchaire (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Histoire des Institutions Monarchiques">Hist. des Instit. Monarch.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 2">vol. ii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 211,
note 1).</p>

<p><abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Mabille however does not attempt to decide who was
Constance’s mother, through whom her kindred with the Angevins is
said to have come; and this is the question which we now have to
investigate. The evidence at present known is as follows<span class="nobreak">:—</span></p>

<p>1.
    <cite>An unprinted <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> of <abbr title="Rudolf">R.</abbr> Glaber’s history, <abbr title="book 3">l. iii.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 2 (quoted
by Mabille, note to Vic and Vaissète, as above, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 158; Marchegay,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191">191</a></span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes d’Anjou</i>, <abbr title="Introduction">Introd.</abbr>, <abbr title="page 73">p. lxxiii.</abbr> note 2)</cite>,
describes Constance as
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">neptem prædicti Fulconis <span class="dots">...</span> natam de Blancâ sorore ejus</span>.” This
is the version adopted in
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta <abbr title="Consulum">Cons.</abbr></i> (Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 110)</cite>.</p>

<p>2. A letter of Bishop Ivo of Chartres
    (<cite><abbr title="Epistle 211">Ep. ccxi.</abbr>, Migne, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Patrologia</i>,
vol. 162, <abbr title="columns">cols.</abbr> 215, 216</cite>), written about <span class="allcap">A.D.</span> 1110, makes
Constance’s mother sister, not of Fulk, but of his father Geoffrey
Greygown. So does an anonymous chronicle ending in 1109,
printed in
    <cite>Duchesne’s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Historia Franconum Scriptores">Hist. Franc. Scriptt.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 4">vol. iv.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 96</cite>.</p>

<p>3. The <abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicæ Sancti Albini">Chron. S. Albin.</abbr> (Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglises</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 21) has under
date 987: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hlotharius rex obiit<span class="dots">...</span>. In isto reges Francorum
defecerunt. Hic accepit uxorem Blanchiam filiam Fulconis Boni
comitis Andegavensium, patris Gaufredi Grisegonellæ, et habuit ex
eâ filiam, Constantiam nomine, quæ fuit data cum regno Roberti
regis filio, scilicet Hugonis Magni.</span>” Wildly confused as this passage
is, I believe that it really contains a clue to the identity of Constance’s
mother. Whoever she was, she certainly must, at the time
of Constance’s birth, have been wife not of Louis the Lazy (who is
evidently meant, instead of Lothar), but of Count William <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> of
Arles. Now it is plain (see
    <cite>Vic and Vaissète as above, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 62,
6</cite>3) that William was twice married; first to Arsindis, who was
living 968–979; and secondly, to Adelaide, who appears in 986,
was mother of his successor William <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, and apparently still living
in 1026. Of Arsindis nothing further is known; but with Adelaide
the case is otherwise. King Louis the Lazy, at some time between
978 and 981, married a lady “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ab Aquitanis partibus</span>”
    (<cite><abbr title="Rudolf">R.</abbr> Glaber,
<abbr title="book 1">l. i.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 3, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Rerum Gallicarum Scriptores">Rer. Gall. Scriptt.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 10">vol. x.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 5</cite>), whose name was Adelaide
according to
    <cite>Richer (<abbr title="book 3">l. iii.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 92)</cite>,
but whom the
    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicæ Sancti Albini">Chron. S. Albin.</abbr></cite>
(as we have already seen) and the
    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicon Sancti Maxentii">Chron. S. Maxent.</abbr> (a. 986,
Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglises</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 382)</cite>
call <em>Blanche</em>. After two years of
marriage with the young king she divorced him, or was divorced by
him, and married <em>William of Arles</em>
    (<cite>Richer, <abbr title="book 3">l. iii.</abbr> <abbr title="chapters">cc.</abbr> 94, 95</cite>). This
is clearly the lady of whom we are in search. The dates fit exactly;
William’s first wife, Arsindis, is dead; he marries the divorced
queen, probably about 982–983, and they have a daughter who in
1000 will be, as Constance evidently was at her marriage, in the
prime of girlish beauty. The probability is strengthened by the
fact that Adelaide’s first husband actually was what
    <cite><abbr title="Rudolf">R.</abbr> Glaber (<abbr title="book 3">l. iii.</abbr>
<abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 2, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Rerum Gallicarum Scriptores">Rer. Gall. Scriptt.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 10">vol. x.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 27)</cite>
mistakenly calls Constance’s
father, count of the “First Aquitaine,” or Toulouse; for
    <cite>Richer (<abbr title="book 3">l. iii.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 92)</cite>
says she was widow of Raymond “duke of the Goths,” <i>i.e.</i>
of Septimania or Toulouse<span class="nobreak">:—</span>by the name of “Candida,” the Latin
equivalent for “Blanche,” given to the wife of William of Arles by
Peter of Maillezais
    (<cite><abbr title="book 1">l. i.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 6, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Rerum Gallicarum Scriptores">Rer. Gall. Scriptt.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 10">vol. x.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 182</cite>;
see
above, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 173, note 5<a href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 386.">{386}</a>);—and even by the blundering Angevin
chronicle which makes Constance a daughter of “Blanche” and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192">192</a></span>
“Lothar,” meaning of course Blanche the wife of Lothar’s son, and
her third husband. This same
    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicæ Sancti Albini">Chron. S. Albin.</abbr></cite>,
however, adds
that the said “Blanche” was a daughter of Fulk the Good. Nobody
else seems to have known her origin, and this very “perplexed
and perplexing” chronicler is a doubtful authority to build upon;
but as there is no intrinsic impossibility in this part of his statement,
and as there evidently was in the early twelfth century a tradition
that Constance was akin to the house of Anjou, he may be right.
From the dates, one would think she was more likely to have been
Greygown’s daughter than his sister. If she was his sister, it must
surely have been by the half-blood. She might be a daughter of
Fulk the Good by his second marriage with the widow of Alan
Barbetorte.</p>

<span class="note_title">THE PILGRIMAGES OF FULK NERRA.</span></h4>

<p>Of all the writers, ancient and modern, who have treated of
Fulk Nerra, scarcely any two are wholly agreed as to the number
and dates of his journeys to Holy Land. Some make out four
journeys; some three; one, his own grandson, makes only two
    (<cite>Fulk Rechin, Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 377</cite>). It is, however, abundantly
evident that there were at least three—one before the foundation
of Beaulieu
    (<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta <abbr title="Consulum">Cons.</abbr></i>, <i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 117</cite>;
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Historia Sancti Florentii Salmurensis">Hist. S. Flor. Salm.</abbr></i>,
Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglises</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 273</cite>); one after the foundation of Beaulieu,
and before that of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Nicolas
    (<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Historia Sancti Florentii Salmurensis">Hist. S. Flor. Salm.</abbr></i> as above, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr>
275</cite>); and one in returning from which he died (see above, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <a href="#Page_168" title="Go to page 168">168</a>).
It is admitted on all hands that his death took place at Metz on
June 21st, 1040; the date of the last pilgrimage is therefore undisputed.
That of the first is now fixed by a charter quoted by <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr>
Mabille
    <cite>(Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="Introduction">Introd.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <abbr title="79">lxxix</abbr></cite>) to 1003. The points
still remaining to be decided therefore are (1) the date of the second
journey; (2) the reality of the third.</p>

<p>The only real clue which our original authorities give us to the
date of the second journey is the statement of
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Historia Sancti Florentii">Hist. S. Flor.</abbr></i></cite>
that
it was after the foundation of Beaulieu and before that of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Nicolas
    (<cite>Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglises</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 275</cite>). Now <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Nicolas was founded in 1020
    (<cite><i>ibid.</i></cite>). Beaulieu was consecrated in 1012, but all we know of its
foundation is that it cannot have been before Fulk’s return from his
first journey in 1004. Modern writers have proposed three different
dates for this second pilgrimage.

    <cite>Ademar of Chabanais (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Rerum Gallicarum Scriptores">Rer. Gall. Scriptt.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 10">vol.
x.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 164)</cite>,
is disposed of at once by the
    <cite>History of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Florence</cite>.
The theory of <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr> de Jubainville has a good deal of plausibility, but
there is no documentary evidence for it. <abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Mabille quotes in support
of his date, 1010, a charter of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Maur-sur-Loire, setting forth
how Fulk, Hildegard and Geoffrey visited that abbey on the eve of
Fulk’s departure for Holy Land. This charter is in
    <cite>Marchegay’s
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives d’Anjou</i>, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 356</cite>;
it has no date of any sort; and it
does not specify whether Fulk’s intended journey was his second or
third. The presence of Geoffrey proves it was not the first, but
nothing more. <abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Mabille pronounces for the second, and dates it
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vers 1010</span>”; but the editor of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives</i>, <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr> Marchegay, says in
a note “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">vers l’an 1030</span>.” This charter therefore does not help at
all. <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr> de Salies
    (<cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Foulques-Nerra</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 143</cite>,
and
    <cite><abbr title="preface">pref.</abbr> <i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <abbr title="32">xxxii</abbr></cite>)
appeals in support of the same date, 1010, to the
    <cite>Chronicle of Tours</cite>,
whose chronology throughout the century is so wild as to have no
weight at all, except in strictly local matters; to the
    <cite><abbr title="Chronica Sancti Petri Senonensis" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chron. S. Petr.
Senon.</abbr></cite>,
where I can find nothing about the question at issue;—and
above all, to a charter in Baluze’s collections which says: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In
natali <abbr title="Sancti">S.</abbr> Barnabæ Apostoli, qui est in Idibus Junii, Rainaldus <span class="dots">...</span>
Andecavensium Episcopus rebus terrenis exemptus est <span class="dots">...</span> Ad
sepulchrum Domini Hierosolymam comitante Fulcone vicecomite
tendebat, progressusque usque Ebredunum</span>” <span class="dots">...</span> died and was there
buried “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">anno ab Incarnatione Domini nostri Jesu Christi 1010</span>.”</p>

<p>In the first place, this charter is suspicious as to date, for the <abbr title="Chronicals of">Chronn.</abbr>
    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Sancti Albini">S. Albin.</abbr> (Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglises</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 22)</cite>,

    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Sancti Florentii Salmurensis">S. Flor. Salm.</abbr> (<i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 187)</cite>,
all date Bishop Rainald’s death 1005,
and so, according to
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gallia Christiana</i>, <abbr title="volume 14">vol. xiv.</abbr> <abbr title="column">col.</abbr> 558</cite>,
does the
    <cite>Obituary of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Maurice</cite>;
and the
    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicon Sancti Sergii">Chron. S. Serg.</abbr> (Marchegay,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglises</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 134)</cite>
dates the consecration of his successor Hubert 1007.
In the next place, what ground has <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr> de Salies for assuming that
“Fulco <em>vice</em>comes” is Fulk Nerra count of Anjou? The authors
of
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gallia Christiana</i></cite>
quote this same charter, and their comment on
it is this: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fulco sedenim comes</span>” [it is <em>vice</em>comes in the charter]
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quocum Rainaldus Hierosolymitanum iter aggressus supra memoratur,
Andegavensis rei curam annum circa 1010, teste non uno,
suscepit</span>.” And as they have been describing various dealings of
the bishop with Fulk the Black long before 1010, it is quite clear
they take this Fulk to be some one else; though one would like to
see their witnesses and know who he really was.</p>

<p>There is however another clue which may suggest a different
date for this second pilgrimage. There are only two ways of making
sense of the account given in the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta <abbr title="Consulum">Cons.</abbr></i> (Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>,
<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 88–91)</cite>
of “the wicked Landry’s” attack on Anjou and the war
of Châteaudun. In that account the first misdoings of Landry and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194">194</a></span>
his aggressions against Sulpice and Archambald of Amboise are put
in the reign of Count Maurice; then Maurice dies and his son Fulk
succeeds him, and the raid upon Châteaudun follows as the first
exploit of “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">juvenis haud modici pectoris</span>.” Now we have seen that
Maurice was not Fulk’s father but his younger brother, and never
was count of Anjou at all. We must therefore either regard the
introduction of Maurice as a complete myth and delusion, or interpret
the tale as a distorted account of a regency undertaken by
Maurice during his brother’s absence. It is hard to see why the
chroniclers should have gratuitously dragged in Maurice without any
reason. Moreover the charter which establishes the date of Fulk’s
first pilgrimage informs us that he left his brother as regent of Anjou
on that occasion
    (<cite>Mabille, <abbr title="Introduction">Introd.</abbr> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <abbr title="76">lxxvi</abbr></cite>); it is therefore
quite possible that he may have done the same thing a second time.
On this theory, to ascertain the date of the war with Landry would
be equivalent to ascertaining the date of Fulk’s second pilgrimage.</p>

<p>If we take the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">
    <cite>Gesta</cite>’s</i> account of Landry just as it stands,
Landry’s attack on Anjou must have been made at the close of
1014 or in 1015; for he was resisted (say they) by Sulpice, treasurer
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin’s, and his brother Archambald. Now Sulpice could not
be treasurer of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin’s before 1014, as his predecessor Hervey
died in that year
    <cite>(<abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicon Turonense Magnum">Chron. Tur. Magn.</abbr> ad <abbr title="annum">ann.</abbr>, Salmon, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Chroniques de Touraine">Chron. de Touraine</abbr></i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 119</cite>;
    <cite>Chronol. S. Mar. Autiss. ad <abbr title="annum">ann.</abbr>, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Rerum Gallicarum Scriptores">Rer. Gall.
Scriptt.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 10">vol. x.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 275</cite>); and on the other hand, Archambald must
have died in 1015 or very early in 1016, for the
    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicon Turonense Magnum">Chron. Tur. Magn.</abbr>
(as above)</cite>—which is likely to be right in its dating of local matters,
though hopelessly confused in its general chronology—places in 1016
the building of Sulpice’s stone tower at Amboise, which the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta
<abbr title="Consulum">Cons.</abbr></i> (Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 88, 89)</cite>
tell us took place after his
brother’s death; and the whole affair was certainly over some time
before July 1016, the date of the battle of Pontlevoy. According
to the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta</i> (as above, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 89, 90)</cite>,
Landry makes another attack on
Sulpice, after his brother’s death, just when Maurice has also died
and Fulk succeeded him [<i>i.e.</i> Fulk has come home and resumed
the reins of government]; and the raid on Châteaudun follows
immediately. Here comes in a new difficulty; Odo of Blois is
now brought in with a minute list of his possessions in Champagne,
which he only acquired in 1019 at earliest, so that if this part of the
story is also to be taken literally, Landry’s war with Sulpice and
Fulk’s raid on Châteaudun must be separated by nearly four years.
Maurice cannot possibly have been regent all that time, so we must
either give him up entirely, or conclude that some of the details are
wrong. And the one most likely to be wrong is certainly the description
of Odo, whom almost all the old writers call “Campanensis”
long before he had any right to the epithet. This is the view of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195">195</a></span>
<abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> d’Arbois de Jubainville, who dates the whole affair of Landry
and Châteaudun in 1012–1014
    (<cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes de Champagne</i>, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr>
227, 228</cite>), but ignores Maurice and puts Fulk’s second journey in
1019, without giving any reason. It seems to me that this strange
Angevin hallucination about Count Maurice, so utterly inexplicable
in any other way, becomes intelligible if we believe that he was
regent of Anjou in 1014–1015 during a second journey of his
brother to Holy Land; a theory which, if it has no positive evidence
to support it, seems at least to have none to contradict it, and is not
rendered improbable by the general condition of Angevin affairs at
the time.</p>

<p>2. As to the third journey. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta <abbr title="Consulum">Cons.</abbr></i> state that Fulk,
on one of his pilgrimages, went in company with Robert the Devil.
Now as Robert died at Nikaia in July 1035 Fulk cannot have met
him on either of his first two journeys, nor on his last; therefore, if
this incident be true, we must insert another pilgrimage in 1034–1035.
The story appears only in the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta <abbr title="Consulum">Cons.</abbr></i></cite>
and is therefore
open to suspicion, as the whole account of Fulk’s travels
there given is a ludicrous tissue of anachronisms
    (<cite>Marchegay,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 100–103</cite>). Fulk first goes to Rome and promises to
deliver Pope Sergius <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr> (who reigned 1009–1012) from Crescentius
(who was killed in 997); then he goes to Constantinople, and
thence in company with Robert to Jerusalem; Robert dies on the
way home (1035) and Fulk on his return founds Beaulieu Abbey
(consecrated 1012.) The monk has confounded at least two
journeys, together with other things which had nothing to do with
either.</p>

<p>The idea of a journey intermediate between the second and the
last is however supported by the story of
    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Ralf de Diceto">R. Diceto</abbr> (Stubbs, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr>
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 164; Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 329)</cite>
that Geoffrey Martel having
been left regent while his father was on pilgrimage kept him out on
his return. Now at the time of Fulk’s first pilgrimage Geoffrey was
not born; at the time of the second he was a mere child; and from
the last Fulk came home only in his coffin. Consequently this
story implies another journey; and we seem to get its date at last
on no less authority than that of Fulk’s own hand.
    <cite>The charter in
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Epitome <abbr title="Sancti">S.</abbr> Nicolai</i> (quoted in Mabillon, <i><abbr title="Annales Benedicti" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ann. Bened.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 4">vol. iv.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr>
386)</cite>,
after relating Fulk’s application to Abbot Walter of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Aubin’s
to find him an abbot for <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Nicolas, and the consequent appointment
of Hilduin in 1033, ends thus: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Res autem præscriptas a domno
Beringario atque domno Reginaldo scribere jussi, et <em>priusquam ad
Jerusalem ultimâ vice perrexissem</em> manu meâ roboravi.</span>” The
    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicæ Sancti Albini">Chron.
S. Albin.</abbr></cite>
says Walter was not abbot till 1036
    (<cite>Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglises</i>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 23</cite>;
the extract in
    <cite>note 3, <i>ibid.</i></cite>,
makes it 1038), and if so the
date of Hilduin’s consecration is wrong. But the authors of
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gallia
Christiana</i></cite><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196">196</a></span> think it more likely that the abbot’s name is wrong and
the date right. Now by “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ultimâ vice</span>” Fulk must have meant “the
journey whence I last returned.” Before starting for that of 1040
he might hope, but he could not know, that it would be his last. So
here we have, apparently, his own authority for a third pilgrimage
soon after Hilduin’s consecration—<i>i.e.</i> in 1034 or 1035.</p>

<p>The worst stumbling-block, however, in the way of our chronology
of Fulk’s last years is William of Malmesbury. He gives a
much fuller account than any one else of Geoffrey’s rebellion and
Fulk’s last pilgrimage, and his account, taken alone, is so thoroughly
self-consistent and reasonable, and withal so graphic, that it is hard
not to be carried away by it. But it utterly contradicts the date
which the sources above examined assign to the third journey, as
well as that which all other authorities agree in assigning to the last,
and also the universally-received account of Fulk’s death. William
    (<cite><abbr title="book 3">l. iii.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 235; Hardy, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 401, 402</cite>) says nothing about Geoffrey
having rebelled during his father’s absence. He tells us that Fulk
in his last years ceded his county to his son; that Geoffrey misconducted
himself, and was brought to submission (here comes in
the story of the saddle); that Fulk in the same year went out to
Palestine (here follows the story of the penance); that he came
quietly home, and died a few years after.</p>

<p>This account of William’s is entitled to very much more respectful
handling than those of the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta Consulum</i></cite>
and
    <cite>Ralf de Diceto</cite>.
William’s statements about the counts of Anjou are of special value,
because they are thoroughly independent; where they come from
is a mystery, but they certainly come from some source perfectly
distinct from those known to us through the Angevin writers.
Moreover William shews a wonderfully accurate appreciation of the
Angevins’ characters and a strong liking for them—above all for
Fulk Nerra, whom he seems to have taken special pains to paint in
the most striking colours. His version therefore is not to be lightly
treated; nevertheless it seems clear that he is not altogether correct.
His omitting all mention of the pilgrimage which immediately preceded
Geoffrey’s rebellion is no proof of its non-reality. His account
of the last journey of all is a graver matter. According to him, it
must have taken place about 1036–1037, and Fulk died, not at
Metz, but at home. There is only one other writer who countenances
this version, and that is the chronicler of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Maxentius
    (<cite>a.
1040, Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglises</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 393</cite>), who says that Fulk died in his
own abbey of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Nicolas at Angers. But this very same chronicle
gives also an alternative statement—the usual one of the death on
pilgrimage which is given by the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta</i>, <abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Ralf de Diceto">R. Diceto</abbr> and Fulk Rechin.
Against either of the two former witnesses singly William’s solitary
word might stand, but not against them with Fulk Rechin to support<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197">197</a></span>
them. The pilgrimages therefore stand thus: 1. in 1003; 2. in
1014–1015; 3. in 1034–1035; 4. in 1040.</p>

<span class="note_title">GEOFFREY MARTEL AND POITOU.</span></h4>

<p>The whole story of Geoffrey Martel’s doings in Poitou—his
wars and his marriage—is involved in the greatest perplexity. There
is no lack of information, but it is a mass of contradictions. The
only writer who professes to account for the origin of the war is the
author of the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta <abbr title="Consulum">Cons.</abbr></i> (Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 126)</cite>,
and his
story, so far as it can apply to anything at all, certainly applies to
the battle of Chef-Boutonne between Geoffrey the Bearded and
William <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr> (Guy-Geoffrey) in 1062. All other authorities are
agreed that the battle was fought at <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Jouin-de-Marne, or Montcontour,
on September 20, 1033, that William was captured and
kept in prison three years, and that he died immediately after his
release. As to the marriage of Geoffrey and Agnes, there is a
question whether it took place before William’s capture or immediately
after his death.</p>

<p>1. The
    <cite><abbr title="Chronicles of">Chronn.</abbr> <abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Sancti Albini">S. Albin.</abbr> and <abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Sancti Sergii">S. Serg.</abbr>, <abbr title="year">a.</abbr> 1032 (Marchegay,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglises</i>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 23, 135)</cite>
say positively that Geoffrey and Agnes were
married on January 1 in that year. The
    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronico Sancti Michaelis in Periculo Maris">Chron. S. Michael. in
Per. Maris</abbr> ad <abbr title="annum">ann.</abbr></cite>
also gives the date 1032
    (<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Rerum Gallicarum Scriptores">Rer. Gall. Scriptt.</abbr></i>,
<abbr title="volume 10">vol. x.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 176</cite>).</p>

<p>2. <abbr title="William of Poitiers">Will. Poitiers</abbr> and <abbr title="William of Malmesbury">Will. Malm.</abbr> say they married after
William’s death. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Porro ipsius defuncti <span class="dots">...</span> novercam <span class="dots">...</span>
thoro suo [Gaufridus] sociavit.</span>”
    <cite><abbr title="William of Poitiers">Will. Poitiers</abbr> (Duchesne, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Historiae Normannorum Scriptores">Hist.
Norm. Scriptt.</abbr></i>), <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 182</cite>.
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tunc Martellus, ne quid deesset impudentiæ,
novercam defuncti matrimonio sibi copulavit.</span>”
    <cite><abbr title="William of Malmesbury">Will. Malm.</abbr>

<p>These five are the only writers who directly mention the
marriage, except the
    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicon Sancti Maxentii">Chron. S. Maxent.</abbr> (Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglises</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 392)</cite>,
which says under date 1037: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Per hæc tempora Gaufredus Martellus
duxerat uxorem supradictam</span>,” etc. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Per hæc tempora</span>” with
the chronicler of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Maxentius is a phrase so frequent and so elastic
that this passage cannot be used to support either of the above
dates. There are therefore three witnesses for 1032, and two for
1036. The chroniclers of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Aubin and <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Sergius are both
Angevin witnesses, and both nearly contemporary; but the <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Sergian writer’s authority is damaged by his having confused the
whole story, for he dates the capture of the duke of Aquitaine in
1028, thus evidently mistaking Agnes’s step-son for her husband.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198">198</a></span>
William of Poitiers is in some sense a Poitevin witness, and is also
nearly contemporary. William of Malmesbury is further from the
source, and in this passage seems to have been chiefly following his
Poitevin namesake, but his whole treatment of the Angevin counts
shews such clear signs of special study and understanding that he is
entitled to be regarded as in some degree an independent authority.</p>

<p>That the marriage was not later than 1036 is certain from several
charters of that year, in which Agnes appears as Geoffrey’s wife
    (<cite>Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives d’Anjou</i>, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 377, 402</cite>). But the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta
<abbr title="Consulum">Cons.</abbr></i> (Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 131, 132)</cite>
tell a story of Geoffrey having
founded his abbey at Vendôme in consequence of a shower of stars
which he saw when standing at his palace window with “his wife,
Agnes by name.” As the first abbot of Holy Trinity at Vendôme
was appointed in 1033
    (<cite>Mabillon, <i><abbr title="Annales Benedicti" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ann. Bened.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 4">vol. iv.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 379</cite>), if
this story is true, Agnes must have been married to Geoffrey in
1032. But unluckily, the foundation-charter of the abbey is
missing. The only documentary evidence connected with the question
consists of two charters. One of these is printed in
    <cite>Besly,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes de Poitou, preuves</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 304</cite>.
It has no date, and simply
conveys some lands for the site of the abbey to Count Geoffrey and
Agnes his wife. Of course if this is the deed of sale for the land
on which the original buildings were begun in 1032, it settles the
question as to the previous marriage; but as the abbey was not
consecrated till 1040, it is quite possible that its building was a
slow process, and more ground was required as it proceeded.
    <cite>The
endowment-charter (dated 1040, Mabillon, <i><abbr title="Annales Benedicti" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ann. Bened.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 4">vol. iv.</abbr>
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 732)</cite>
says: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ego Goffredus comes et uxor mea Agnes <span class="dots">...</span>
monasterium <span class="dots">...</span> <em>a novo</em> fundaremus.</span>” Does the solution lie in
those words, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">a novo</span>”? Did Geoffrey found his abbey alone in
1032; stop work for a while on account of the Poitevin war and
his quarrel with his father; and then, having married Agnes and
acquired means by her step-son’s ransom, set to work in earnest conjointly
with her and found the abbey anew? It is hard to throw
over the distinct statements of two such writers as William of
Poitiers and William of Malmesbury for the sake of three not very
accurate chronicles and a late twelfth century romancer, doubtfully
supported by a very vague charter.</p>

<p>As to the crime of the marriage, it is only the Angevin chroniclers
who are so shocked at it. The <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Sergian writer’s mistake
between Agnes’s first husband and her step-son might account for
his horror, but not for the word he uses; and the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Historia Sancti Florentii Salmurensis">Hist. S. Flor.
Salm.</abbr></i> (Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglises</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 282)</cite>
which uses the same, says distinctly
that her husband was dead. The two Williams seem to see
nothing worse in it than some “impudence” in the count of Vendôme
daring to take a wife of such high birth and position. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199">199</a></span>
    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicon Sancti Maxentii">Chron. S. Maxent.</abbr></cite>
makes no remark on the subject; the chronicler
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Sergius seems to have thought that Geoffrey’s kinship was not
with Agnes herself, but with her former husband, for he says that
Geoffrey married her “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quæ fuerat consobrini sui Willelmi <span class="dots">...</span>
uxor</span>.” The canon law forbade marriages within the seventh degree
of kindred; and as the pedigrees of none of the three persons concerned
in this case can be traced back with certainty in all their
branches up to the seventh generation, it is quite impossible to say
what consanguinity there may or may not have been among them.
The strong language of the Angevin chroniclers, however, seems to
indicate no obscure and remote connexion, but a close and obvious
one. There are two possibilities which present themselves at once.
1. We do not know at all who Geoffrey’s mother Hildegard was.
2. We are not perfectly sure who his grandmother Adela was.
Hildegard may have been a daughter of Poitou, in which case her
son would be akin to William; or a daughter of Burgundy, and
then he would be akin to Agnes. Or again, if Adela of Chalon
really was daughter to Robert of Troyes, and if she was also really
Geoffrey’s grandmother, then William, Agnes and Geoffrey would
be all cousins to each other—Agnes and William in the fifth degree,
Geoffrey and William in the fourth, Geoffrey and Agnes in the
third. The pedigree stands as follows<span class="nobreak">:—</span></p>

<p>Strictly speaking, this would make both Agnes’s marriages wrong;
but the kindred in the case of the second would be much closer,
and aggravated by that between Geoffrey and William; and a dispensation
might very probably have been obtained for the first
marriage, while for the second it is plain that none was even sought.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">It is just possible that there was also a spiritual affinity. Agnes’s
younger son bore the two names of Guy and Geoffrey; it is not
clear which was his baptismal name; but the idea suggests itself
that it may have been Geoffrey, and that he may have been godson
to the Hammer of Anjou. The case would then be something like
that of Robert and Bertha.</p>

<span class="ch2">ANJOU AND NORMANDY.</span><br />

<span class="ch3">1044–1128.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> history of Anjou during the sixty years comprised in
our last chapter groups itself around the figure of Fulk the
Black. The period on which we are now to enter has no
such personal centre of unity; its interest and its significance
lie in the drama itself rather than in its actors; yet the drama
has a centre which is living to this day. The city of Le
Mans still stands, as it stood in Geoffrey Martel’s day and
had stood for a thousand years before him, on the long
narrow brow of a red sandstone rock which rises abruptly
from the left bank of the Sarthe and widens out into the
higher ground to the north and east<span class="nobreak">:—</span>a situation not unlike
that of Angers on its black rock above the Mayenne. The
city itself and the county of Maine, of which it was the
capital, both took their names from a tribe known to the
Romans as Aulerci Cenomanni, a branch of the great race
of the Aulerci who occupied central Gaul in its earliest
recorded days. Alike in legend and in history the Cenomanni
are closely linked to Rome. One branch of them
formed, according to Roman tradition, a portion of a band
of Gallic emigrants who in the mythical days of the Tarquins
wandered down through the Alpine passes into the valleys
and plains of northern Italy, made themselves a new home
on the banks of Padus, where afterwards grew up the towns
of Brixia and Verona,<a id="Anchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 440.">[440]</a> and became devoted allies of Rome.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202">202</a></span><a id="Anchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 441.">[441]</a>
When the last struggle for freedom was over in Gaul, few
spots took the impress of Rome more deeply or kept it
more abidingly than the home of their Transalpine brethren,
the “Aulerci Cenomanni whose city to the east is Vindinum.”<a id="Anchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 442.">[442]</a>
The remains of the walls and gates of a Roman
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">castrum</i> which succeeded the primeval hill-fortress of
Vindinum or Le Mans are only now at last giving way to
the destruction, not of time, but of modern utilitarianism.
Far into the middle ages, long after Le Mans had outgrown
its narrow Roman limits and spread down to a second line
of fortifications close to the water’s edge, one part of the
city on the height still kept the name of “Ancient Rome.”<a id="Anchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 443.">[443]</a>
The wondrous cathedral which now rises in the north-eastern
corner of the city, towering high above the river and the
double line of walls, stands, if we may trust its foundation-legend,
on the very site of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prætorium</i>; when the Cross
followed in the train of the eagles, Defensor, the governor of
the city, gave up his palace for the site of a church whose
original dedication to the Blessed Virgin and <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Peter has
long been superseded by the name of its founder <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Julian, a
missionary bishop ordained and sent to Gaul by <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Clement
of Rome.<a id="Anchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 444.">[444]</a> Defensor is probably only a personification of
the official <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">defensor civitatis</i>, the local tribune of the people
under the later Roman Empire; but the state of things of
which the legend is an idealized picture left its traces on the
real relations of Church and state at Le Mans. After the
Frankish conquest bishop and people together formed a
power which more than matched that of the local lieutenant
of the Merovingian kings; a decree of Clovis, confirmed by
his grandson Childebert <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>, enacted that no count of Le
Mans should be appointed without their consent.<a id="Anchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 445.">[445]</a> Under
the early Karolingians Le Mans seems to have held for a
short time the rank afterwards taken by Angers as the chief
stronghold of the Breton border; local tradition claims as its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
first hereditary count that “Roland, prefect of the Breton
march,” who is more generally known as the hero of Roncevaux.<a id="Anchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 446.">[446]</a>
However this may be, the “duchy of Cenomannia”
figures prominently in various grants of territory on the
western border made to members of the Imperial house.<a id="Anchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 447.">[447]</a>
In the civil wars which followed the death of Louis the
Gentle it suffered much from the ravages of Lothar;<a id="Anchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 448.">[448]</a> and it
underwent a far worse ordeal a few years later, when the
traitor count Lambert of Anjou led both Bretons and
northmen into the heart of central Gaul. The sack of Le
Mans by Lambert and Nomenoë in 850<a id="Anchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 449.">[449]</a> was avenged some
years later when the traitor fell by the sword of Count
Gauzbert of Maine;<a id="Anchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 450.">[450]</a> but in 851 Charles the Bald was compelled
to cede the western part of the Cenomannian duchy
to the Breton king Herispoë;<a id="Anchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 451.">[451]</a> the northern foes who had
first come in the train of the Bretons swept over Maine
again and again; and it was in making their way back to
the sea after one of these raids by the old Roman road from
Le Mans to Nantes that they entrapped Robert the Brave to
his death at the bridge of Sarthe. The treaty of Clair-sur-Epte
left Maine face to face with the northman settled upon
her northern border; and in 924 a grant of the overlordship
of the county was extorted by Hrolf from King Rudolf of
Burgundy. In the hands of Hrolf’s most famous descendant
the claim thus given was to become a formidable reality; at
the moment however its force was neutralized by another
grant made in the same year by Charles the Simple, which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204">204</a></span>
placed Maine together with the rest of Neustria under the
jurisdiction of Hugh the Great.<a id="Anchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 452.">[452]</a> In vain the counts of Le
Mans strove to ignore or defy the house of France and that
of Anjou, to which, as we have seen, the ducal claims over
Maine were soon delegated. All their efforts were paralyzed
by the opposing influence of that other officer in their state
whose authority was of older date as well as loftier character
than theirs, who held his commission by unbroken
descent alike from the Cæsars and from the Apostles, and
who had once at least been distinctly acknowledged as the
equal, if not the superior, of his temporal colleague. The
bishops were the nominees of the king, and therefore the
champions of French and Angevin interests at Le Mans.
In the last years of the tenth century and the early part of
the eleventh, two of them in succession, an uncle and nephew
named Sainfred and Avesgaud, were members of the house
of Bellême who owned the borderlands of Perche, Séez and
Alençon, between France and Normandy, who were never
loyal to either neighbour, and whose name, as we have
already seen, was one day to become a by-word for turbulent
wickedness both in Normandy and in England.
Sainfred was said to have owed his bishopric to Fulk
Nerra’s influence with the king;<a id="Anchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 453.">[453]</a> Avesgaud’s life was passed
between building, hunting, and quarrelling with Count Herbert
Wake-dog. Herbert’s military capacities, proved on
the field of Pontlevoy, enabled him to stand his ground;<a id="Anchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 454.">[454]</a>
but very soon after his death Fulk’s dealings with Maine
and its bishop began to bear fruit. Fulk survived both
Herbert and Avesgaud. The count of Maine died in the
prime of life in 1036,<a id="Anchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 455.">[455]</a> leaving as his heir a son named
Hugh, who, on pretext of his extreme youth, was set aside
by a great-uncle, Herbert surnamed Bacco. Bishop Avesgaud<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205">205</a></span>,
too, had died a few months before, and his office
passed a second time from uncle to nephew in the person of
his sister’s son, Gervase of Château-du-Loir.<a id="Anchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 456.">[456]</a> The selection
of a third prelate from the hated house of Bellême was in
itself enough to excite the count’s wrath; Herbert Bacco
moreover had a special reason for jealousy—the young
nephew whose rights he had usurped was a godson of
Gervase. For two years Herbert contrived to keep the new
bishop out of Le Mans altogether; at the end of that time
he admitted him, but no sooner were the rival rulers established
side by side than their strife became as bitter and
ceaseless as that of Herbert Wake-dog and Avesgaud.
Gervase looked for help to the king, who, whether as king
or as duke of the French, was patron and advocate of the
see; but there was no help to be got from the feeble, selfish
Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> of France. Despair hurried the bishop into a
rasher step than any that his uncle had ever taken. Thinking
that a less exalted protector, and one nearer to the spot
and more directly interested, would be of more practical use,
he besought King Henry to grant the patronage and advocacy
of the see of Le Mans to Count Geoffrey of Anjou for
his life.<a id="Anchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 457.">[457]</a></p>

<p>As soon as the grant was made, Gervase “took counsel
with the people of the diocese and the brave men of the
land,”<a id="Anchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 458.">[458]</a> and headed a revolution by which Herbert Bacco was
expelled and the boy Hugh set in his place. The bishop’s
next step was to seek a wife for his godson. Twelve years
before, a band of Bretons, called by Hugh’s father to aid him
against Bishop Avesgaud and Fulk of Anjou, had made a
raid upon Blois and carried off Count Odo’s daughter Bertha
to become the wife of Duke Alan of Britanny.<a id="Anchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 459.">[459]</a> It was this
Bertha, now a widow and a fugitive from Rennes, whence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
she was driven by her brother-in-law after her husband’s
death,<a id="Anchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 460.">[460]</a> whom Gervase now wedded to Hugh. Such a choice
was not likely to conciliate Geoffrey Martel; all the less if—as
some words of a local historian seem to imply—the
daughter of Odo of Blois was gifted with all the courage and
energy that were lacking in her brothers.<a id="Anchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 461.">[461]</a> By some of the
usual Angevin arts Geoffrey entrapped Gervase into his
power and cast him into prison,<a id="Anchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 462.">[462]</a> where for the next seven
years the luckless bishop was left to reflect upon the consequences
of his short-sighted policy and to perceive that in
striving to secure a protector against Herbert Bacco he
had placed himself and his country at the mercy of an
unscrupulous tyrant. During those years Maine, nominally
ruled by the young Count Hugh, was really in the power
of Geoffrey Martel, and it became the scene of a fierce
warfare between Anjou and Normandy. In 1049 the
Council of Reims threatened Geoffrey with excommunication
unless he released the captive prelate,<a id="Anchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 463.">[463]</a> and next
year the excommunication was actually pronounced by the
Pope;<a id="Anchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 464.">[464]</a> but neither Council nor Pope could turn the
Angevin from his prey. About 1051 Hugh died, and his
death sealed the fate of Le Mans. Its count’s son was
an infant, its bishop a captive in an Angevin dungeon; its
citizens had no choice but to submit. The twice-widowed
countess and her children were driven out at one gate as
the Hammer of Anjou knocked at the other, and without
striking a blow Geoffrey became acknowledged master of
Maine from thenceforth till the day of his death.<a id="Anchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 465.">[465]</a> Gervase,
his spirit broken at last, purchased his release by
the surrender of Château-du-Loir, and by a solemn oath
never again to set foot in Le Mans so long as Geoffrey
lived. He found a refuge at the court of Duke William of
Normandy, till in 1057 he was raised to the metropolitan<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207">207</a></span>
chair of Reims.<a id="Anchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 466.">[466]</a> In his former episcopal city the oppressor
triumphed undisturbed; but the day of retribution had
already dawned.</p>

<p>The tide of fortune which had borne Geoffrey Martel on
from victory to victory spent its last wave in carrying him to
the brow of the Cenomannian hill. The acquisition of Le
Mans was the last outward mark of his success; the height
of his real security had been passed three years before. The
turning-point of Geoffrey’s life was the year 1044. The
settlement of Poitou, the winning of Tours, the capture of
Bishop Gervase, all followed close upon each other; and for
the next four years the count of Anjou was beyond all
question the second power in the kingdom. No one save
the duke of Normandy could claim to stand on a level with
the lord of the Angevin march, of Touraine and Saintonge,
the step-father and guardian of the boy-duke of Aquitaine,
the virtual master of Maine. It was with the duke of Normandy
that Geoffrey’s last conquest now brought him into
collision. His head had been turned by his easy and rapid
successes; in 1048, on his return from an expedition to
Apulia in company with his wife’s son-in-law the Emperor,<a id="Anchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 467.">[467]</a>
he set himself up against King Henry with a boastful insolence
which threatened to disturb the peace of the whole
realm.<a id="Anchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 468.">[468]</a> Five years earlier, Henry had profited by the feud
between Anjou and Blois to win Geoffrey’s help in putting
down the rebellion of Theobald; now he profited by the
jealousy which the state of Cenomannian affairs was just beginning
to create between Anjou and Normandy to win the
help of the Norman Duke William in putting down the rebellion
of Geoffrey. The king’s own operations against Anjou
seem to have extended no further than a successful siege of the
castle of Moulinières;<a id="Anchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 469.">[469]</a> after this his conduct towards William
seems to have been copied from that of his parents towards<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208">208</a></span>
Fulk the Black three and twenty years before. William,
like Fulk, was left to fight the royal battles single-handed;
and to William, as to Fulk, the task was welcome, for the
battle was in truth less the king’s than his own. Geoffrey
Martel, in the pride of his heart, had openly proclaimed his
ambition to crown all his previous triumphs by an encounter
with the only warrior whom he deigned to regard as a foeman
worthy of his steel,<a id="Anchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 470.">[470]</a> and had diligently used all the opportunities
for provoking a quarrel with the Norman which the
dependent position of Maine furnished but too readily.
Either by force or guile, or that judicious mixture of both
in which the Angevin house excelled, he had managed to
get into his own hands the two keys of Normandy’s southern
frontier, the castles of Alençon and Domfront, which guarded
the valleys of the Sarthe and the Mayenne;<a id="Anchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 471.">[471]</a> and thence,
across the debateable lands of Bellême, he was now carrying
his raids into undisputed Norman territory.<a id="Anchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 472.">[472]</a></p>

These two writers ignore
the king’s share in the quarrel, and make it arise solely from Geoffrey’s raids upon
Normandy (“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Brachium levabat in nos quo non leviter sese vulnerabat</span>,” remarks
<abbr title="William of Poitiers">W. Poitiers</abbr>,

reverse the
whole situation and assert that William attacked the count of Maine, whereupon
Geoffrey, as the latter’s “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">auxiliator et tutor</span>,” took up the quarrel, and did William
a great deal of damage! Fulk Rechin
    (<cite>Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 378</cite>) wisely limits
himself to the statement that his uncle “had a war with William, duke of the
Normans.”
  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>In the autumn of 1048 William set out to dislodge the
intruder from Domfront. It was no light undertaking. The
ruined keep which still stands, a splendid fragment, on the
top of a steep wall-like pile of grey rock, the last spur of a
ridge of hills sweeping round from the east, with the town
and the dark woods at its back and the little stream of
Varenne winding close round its foot, may tell something of
what the castle was when its walls stood foursquare, fresh
from the builder’s hand, and manned by the fierce moss-troopers
of Bellême, reinforced by a band of picked soldiers
from Anjou.<a id="Anchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 473.">[473]</a> The rock itself was an impregnable fortress of
nature’s own making. To horsemen it was totally inaccessible;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209">209</a></span>
foot-soldiers could only scale it by two narrow and
difficult paths. Assault was hopeless; William’s only chance
lay in a blockade, and even this was an enterprise of danger
as well as difficulty, for Domfront stood in the heart of a
dense woodland amid which the Normans were continually
exposed to the ambushes and surprises of the foe. To
William however the forest was simply a hunting-ground
through which he rode day after day, with hawk on wrist,
in scornful defiance of its hidden perils, while the siege was
pressed closer and closer all through the winter’s snows, till
at last the garrison were driven to call upon Geoffrey
Martel for relief.<a id="Anchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 474.">[474]</a> What followed reads like an anticipation
of the story of Prestonpans as told in Jacobite song. If we
may trust the Norman tale, Geoffrey not only answered the
call, but sent his trumpeter with a formal challenge to the
young duke of the Normans to meet him on the morrow at
break of day beneath the walls of Domfront. But when the
sun rose on that morrow, Geoffrey and all his host were gone.<a id="Anchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 475.">[475]</a>
Duke William’s chaplain, who tells the tale, could see but
one obvious explanation of their departure; and it is impossible
to contradict him, for the whole campaign of 1048
is a blank in the pages of the Angevin chroniclers. The
Hammer of Anjou stands charged with having challenged
Duke William at eventide and run away from him before
sunrise, and no Angevin voice seems ever to have been
lifted to deny or palliate the charge. He had scarcely
turned his back when Alençon fell; and its fall was quickly
followed by that of Domfront. William carried away his
engines of war to set them up again on undisputed Cenomannian
ground, at Ambrières on the Mayenne: still
Geoffrey made no movement; William laid the foundations
of a castle on the river-bank at Ambrières, and leaving it
securely guarded marched home unmolested to Rouen.<a id="Anchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 476.">[476]</a></p>

<p>So began the most momentous feud ever waged by the
counts of Anjou. After the first burst of the storm came
a lull of nearly seven years, one of which was marked, as we
have seen, by Geoffrey’s final acquisition of Le Mans; but
his power had sustained a shock from which it never wholly
recovered. In the struggles with Normandy which fill the
latter years of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> of France, the king and the count
of Anjou play an almost equally ignoble part. Henry, who
had once courted the friendship of William to ward off the
blows of the Angevin Hammer, no sooner perceived which
was really the mightier of the two princes than he completely
reversed his policy, gave an almost open support to
the treasons in William’s duchy, and at length, in 1054,
when these indirect attacks had failed, summoned all the
princes of his realm to join him in a great expedition for
the ruin of the duke of Normandy. They flocked to the
muster at Mantes from all quarters save one; strangely
enough, the count of Anjou was missing.<a id="Anchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 477.">[477]</a> Only a few
months ago the terror which clung around Martel’s name
and the number of troops at his command had sufficed to
make his stepson William of Aquitaine disband an army
with which he was preparing to encounter him, and sue for
peace at his mere approach;<a id="Anchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 478.">[478]</a> yet it seems that not even
with all the forces of king and kingdom at his side would
Geoffrey risk an encounter with the man whom he had
challenged and fled from at Domfront.</p>

  </li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>By thus deserting the king at a moment when Henry
had every reason to count upon his support, Geoffrey escaped
all part in the rout of Mortemer; but the consequence was
that when peace was made next year between the king and
the duke, one of its clauses authorized William to make any
conquests he could at the expense of the count of Anjou.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211">211</a></span><a id="Anchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 479.">[479]</a>
William at once sent warning to Geoffrey to expect him and
all his forces at Ambrières within forty days. South of
Ambrières, lower down in the valley of the Mayenne, stands
the town which bears the same name as the river; its lord,
Geoffrey, was the chief man of the district. He went in
haste to his namesake and overlord and bitterly complained
to him that if these Normans were left unhindered to work
their will at Ambrières, the whole land would be at their
mercy. “Cast me off as a vile and unworthy lord,” was
Martel’s reply, “if thou seest me tamely suffer that which
thou fearest!” But the boast was as vain as the challenge
before Domfront. William completed without hindrance
his fortifications at Ambrières; as soon as his back was
turned Geoffrey laid siege to the place, in company with
the duke of Aquitaine and Odo, uncle and guardian of the
young duke of Britanny; but the mere rumour of William’s
approach sufficed to make all three withdraw their troops
“with wonderful speed, not to say in trembling flight.”
Geoffrey of Mayenne, made prisoner and left to bear alone
the whole weight of William’s wrath, took the count of
Anjou at his word, and casting off the “vile and unworthy
lord” whose desertion had brought him to this strait, owned
himself the “man” of the Norman duke.<a id="Anchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 480.">[480]</a></p>

<p>Two castles in the heart of Maine thus acknowledged
William for their lord. Three years passed away without
further advance from either side; Geoffrey’s energies were
frittered away in minor disputes which brought him neither
gain nor honour. The old quarrel about Nantes woke up
once more and was once more settled in 1057 under circumstances
very discreditable to the count of Anjou. Duke Alan
of Britanny died in 1040, leaving as his heir a boy three
months old. The child was at once snatched from the care
of his mother—Bertha of Blois—by his uncle Odo, who set
himself up as duke of Britanny in his stead.<a id="Anchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 481.">[481]</a> The duchy
split up into factions, and for sixteen years all was confusion,
aggravated, there can be little doubt, by the meddlesomeness
of Geoffrey of Anjou, who seems to have taken<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212">212</a></span>
the opportunity thus offered him for picking a quarrel with
count Hoel of Nantes.<a id="Anchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 482.">[482]</a> In 1056 or 1057, however, a
party among the Breton nobles succeeded in freeing the
young Conan, by whom Odo was shortly afterwards made
prisoner in his turn.<a id="Anchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 483.">[483]</a> On this Geoffrey, it seems, following
the traditional policy of the Angevin house in Britanny,
made alliance with his late enemy the count of Nantes;
and Hoel, on some occasion which is not explained, actually
ventured to intrust his capital to Geoffrey’s keeping, whereupon
Geoffrey at once laid a plot for taking possession of it
altogether. His treachery however met the reward which
it deserved; he held Nantes for barely forty days, and then
lost it for ever.<a id="Anchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 484.">[484]</a> Troubles were springing up too in another
quarter. Geoffrey’s marriage with the widowed countess of
Poitou had failed to bring him the advantages for which he
doubtless hoped when he carried it through in defiance of
public opinion and his father’s will. He had been unable
to keep any hold over his stepsons. Guy-Geoffrey fought
and bargained with the rival claimant of Gascony till he
had made himself sole master of the county: Peter-William,
though he bears the surname of “the Bold,” seems to have
kept his land in peace, for his reign is a blank in which the
only break is caused by his quarrels with Anjou. The first
of these, in 1053, came as we have seen to no practical
consequence, and two years later William is found by
Geoffrey’s side at Ambrières. But the tie between them
was broken; Geoffrey and Agnes were no longer husband
and wife,<a id="Anchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 485.">[485]</a> and Geoffrey was married to Grecia of Montreuil.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213">213</a></span>
There are sufficient indications of Geoffrey’s private character
to warrant the assumption that the blame of this divorce
rested chiefly upon his shoulders,<a id="Anchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 486.">[486]</a> and it may be that Peter-William
acted as the avenger of his mother’s wrongs. The
quarrel, whatever may have been its grounds, broke out
afresh in the spring or early summer of 1058, when the
duke of Aquitaine blockaded Geoffrey himself within the
walls of Saumur. But before the end of August a sudden
sickness drove William of Aquitaine home to Poitiers to
die,<a id="Anchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 487.">[487]</a> and set the Angevin count free for one last struggle
with William of Normandy.</p>

<p>King Henry was now gathering up his strength for
another invasion of the Norman duchy. This time Geoffrey
did not fail him. Both had discovered, too late, who was
really their most dangerous rival, and all old grudges
between them were forgotten in the common instinct of
vengeance upon the common foe. Early in 1058 Henry
came to visit the count at Angers;<a id="Anchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 488.">[488]</a> and the plan of the
coming campaign was no doubt arranged during the time
which they then spent together. It was to be simply a
vast plundering-raid; neither king nor count had now any
ambition to meet the duke in open fight. In August they
set forth—Geoffrey, full of zeal, at the head of all the troops
which his four counties could muster. The French and
Angevin host went burning and plundering through the
Hiesmois and the Bessin, the central districts of Normandy,
as far as Caen. Half of the confederates’ scheme
was accomplished; but as they crossed the Dive at the ford
of Varaville they were overtaken at once by the inflowing
tide and by the duke himself; the two leaders, who had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214">214</a></span>
been the first to cross, could only look helplessly on at the
total destruction of their host, and make their escape from
Norman ground as fast as their horses would carry them.<a id="Anchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 489.">[489]</a>
The wars of Henry and Geoffrey were over. The king died
in the summer of 1060; in November he was followed by
the count of Anjou. A late-awakened conscience moved
Geoffrey to meet his end in the abbey of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Nicolas which
had been founded by his father and completed under his
own care. One night he was borne across the river and
received the monastic habit; next morning at the hour of
prime he died.<a id="Anchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 490.">[490]</a></p>

<p>With him expired the male line of Fulk the Red. But
there was no lack of heirs by the spindle-side. Geoffrey’s
eldest nephew was his half-sister Adela’s son, Fulk “the
Gosling,” to whom after long wrangling he had been compelled
to restore the county of Vendôme.<a id="Anchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 491.">[491]</a> He was bound
by closer ties to the two sons of his own sister Hermengard,

<p>The dominion which Geoffrey the Hammer thus bequeathed
to Geoffrey the Bearded was no compact, firmly-knit
whole; it was a bundle of four separate states, held on
different tenures, and two of them burthened with a legacy
of unsettled feuds. The real character of their union shewed
itself as soon as Martel was gone. What had held them
together was simply the terror of his name, and the dissolution,
already threatening before his death, set in so rapidly
that in less than three years afterwards two out of his four
counties were lost to his successor. It was in fact only the
dominions of Fulk the Black—Anjou and Touraine—that
were thoroughly loyal to his son. Geoffrey’s last conquest,
Maine, was only waiting till death should loose the iron
grasp that choked her to recall her ancient line. His earliest
conquest, Saintonge, lying further from the control of the
central power, was already drifting back to its natural
Aquitanian master. Young Count Fulk was still at his
uncle’s death-bed when Saintes was surprised and captured
by the duke of Aquitaine,—Guy-Geoffrey of Gascony, who
had succeeded his twin-brother by the title of William <abbr title="the Seventh">VII.</abbr>
William seems to have justified his aggression on the plea
that by the terms of the cession of 1036 Martel had no
right to leave Saintonge to collateral heirs, and that on his
death without children it ought to revert to the duke.<a id="Anchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 495.">[495]</a> The
city of Saintes itself however had been Angevin ever since
Fulk Nerra’s days, and a strong party of citizens devoted to
Anjou besought Geoffrey’s successor to come and deliver
them. While the two brothers prepared to march into
Poitou, William gathered an immense force to the siege of
Chef-Boutonne, a castle on a rocky height above the river
Boutonne, on the borders of Poitou and Saintonge. Thence,
at the Angevins’ approach, he descended to meet them in the
plain, on <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Benedict’s day, March 21, 1061. The duke’s
army, including as it did the whole forces of Gascony and
Aquitaine, must have far outnumbered that of the brother-counts;
but there was treason in the southern ranks; the
standard-bearers were the first to flee, and their flight caused<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216">216</a></span>
the rout of the whole ducal host.<a id="Anchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 496.">[496]</a> Saintes threw open its
gates to the Angevin victor;<a id="Anchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 497.">[497]</a> but its loss was only delayed.
Next year the duke of Aquitaine blockaded the city till
sword and famine compelled the garrison to surrender;<a id="Anchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 498.">[498]</a> and
from that moment Saintonge was lost to the count of Anjou.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a change fraught with far graver consequences
had undone Geoffrey Martel’s work in the north. The conqueror
of Le Mans was scarcely in his grave when Maine
flung off the yoke and called upon the son of her late count
Hugh to come home and enjoy his own again. It was however
but a shadowy coronet that she could offer now; her
independence had received a fatal shock; and, to increase
the difficulty of his position, Herbert <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> was still a mere
boy, without a friend to guide and protect him except his
mother, Bertha of Blois. Bertha saw at once that his only
chance of saving his father’s heritage from the shame of
subjection to Anjou was to throw himself on the honour of
the duke of Normandy; to William therefore, as overlord,
Herbert commended himself and his county, on the terms of
the old grant made to Hrolf by King Rudolf.<a id="Anchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 499.">[499]</a> The commendation
was accompanied by an agreement that Herbert
should in due time marry one of William’s daughters; but
there seems to have been a foreboding that the boy-count’s
life was not to be a long one, for it was further provided
that if he died without children Maine should revert in full
property to William;<a id="Anchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 500.">[500]</a> and a marriage was also arranged
between William’s eldest son Robert and Herbert’s sister
Margaret, whereby in the next generation the rights of the
“man” and his lord, of the house of Hrolf and the house of
Herbert Wake-Dog, might be united.<a id="Anchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 501.">[501]</a></p>

<p>In 1064 Herbert died, leaving neither child nor wife.
By the treaty which had seemed so admirably planned to
meet all possible contingencies, his county was now to revert
to William; but there was more than one difficulty to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217">217</a></span>
met before he could take possession of it. The first was a
sudden revival of the Angevin claim. The indifference with
which Geoffrey the Bearded seems to have viewed the transactions
between Herbert and William may perhaps have
been due to the pressure of the war in Saintonge. Far
more puzzling than his tardiness in asserting his rights to
the overlordship of Maine is the readiness with which, when
he did assert them, they seem to have been admitted by
William. Geoffrey did not indeed aspire to the actual
possession of the county which his uncle had enjoyed; all
that he claimed was its overlordship; and William, it seems,
acknowledged his claim by permitting the little Robert to
do him homage at Alençon and to receive from him a formal
grant of Margaret’s hand together with the whole honour of
Maine.<a id="Anchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 502.">[502]</a> Geoffrey’s action is easily accounted for. His only
reasonable course was to make a compromise with Normandy:
the wonder is that he was allowed to make it on
such favourable terms. If the story is correct, the truth probably
is that compromise was at this moment almost as
needful to William as to Geoffrey, for any Angevin intermeddling
in Maine would have rendered his difficulties there
all but insurmountable. One clause of the treaty of 1061—the
marriage of Robert and Margaret—was still in the
remote future, for the bridegroom cannot have been more
than nine years old, and the bride was far away in what a
Norman writer vaguely describes as “Teutonic parts.”<a id="Anchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 503.">[503]</a>
There being thus no security that the county would ever
revert to the descendants of its ancient rulers, Cenomannian
loyalty turned its hopes from Hugh’s young daughter to her
aunts, the three daughters of Herbert Wake-the-dog, of
whom the nearest to the spot was Biota, the wife of Walter
of Mantes, sister’s son to Eadward the Confessor.<a id="Anchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 504.">[504]</a> In his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218">218</a></span>
wife’s name Walter laid claim to the whole county of Maine,
and a considerable part of it at once passed into his hands.
The capital was held for him by Hubert of Sᵗᵉ-Suzanne and
Geoffrey of Mayenne—that same Geoffrey who, deceived in
his Angevin overlord, had yielded a compulsory homage to
William, and now, casting off all foreign masters alike,
proved the most determined champion of his country’s independence.
It was between William and Geoffrey of
Mayenne that the contest really lay; and again the duke
proved victorious. The conqueror made his “joyous entry”
into Le Mans, and sent for the little Margaret to be kept
under his own protection until her marriage could take place.
But before the wedding-day arrived she lay in her grave at
Fécamp; Walter and Biota had already come to a mysterious
end; and the one gallant Cenomannian who held out when
Walter and all else had yielded—Geoffrey of Mayenne—was
at length compelled to surrender.<a id="Anchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 505.">[505]</a> Thenceforth William ruled
Maine as its Conqueror, and as long as he lived, save for one
brief moment, the homage due to Anjou was heard of no more.</p>

The story is somewhat
suspicious, because Orderic tells it not in its proper place, but in a sort of summary
of Cenomannian history, introductory to the war of 1073; so that it looks very
much like a confused anticipation of the treaty of Blanchelande (see below, <a href="#Page_223" title="Go to page 223">p. 223</a>).

<p>The rapid decline of the Angevin power after Geoffrey
Martel’s death was due partly to the reaction which often
follows upon a sudden rise, partly to the exceptional greatness
of the rival with whom the Angevin count had to deal
in the person of William the Conqueror. But behind and
beyond these two causes lay a third more fatal than either.
The house of Anjou was divided against itself. From the
hour of Martel’s death, a bitter dispute over his testamentary
dispositions had been going on between his nephews.
To young Fulk it seemed an unpardonable wrong that he
was left without provision—for even Saintonge, as we have
seen, had now slipped from his grasp—while his elder brother
was in full possession not only of the paternal county of
Gâtinais but also of their uncle’s heritage. In later days
Fulk went so far as to declare that his uncle had intended
to make him sole heir, to the complete exclusion of Geoffrey
the Bearded.<a id="Anchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 506.">[506]</a> Fulk is in one aspect a very interesting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219">219</a></span>
person. Almost the sole authority which we possess for the
history of the early Angevin counts is a fragment written in
his name. If it be indeed his work—and criticism has as
yet failed to establish any other conclusion—Fulk Rechin is
not merely the earliest historian of Anjou; he is well-nigh
the first lay historian of the Middle Ages.<a id="Anchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 507.">[507]</a> But in every
other point of view he deserves nothing but aversion and
contempt. His very surname tells its own tale; in one of
the most quarrelsome families known to history, he was pre-eminently
distinguished as “the Quarreller.”<a id="Anchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 508.">[508]</a> With the
turbulence, the greed, the wilfulness of his race he had also
their craft and subtlety, their plausible, insinuating, serpent-like
cleverness; but he lacked the boldness of conception,
the breadth of view and loftiness of aim, the unflinching
perseverance, the ungrudging as well as unscrupulous devotion
to a great and distant end, which lifted their subtlety
into statesmanship and their cleverness into genius. The
same qualities in him degenerated into mere artfulness and
low cunning, and were used simply to meet his own personal
needs and desires of the moment, not to work out any far-reaching
train of policy. He is the only one of the whole
line of Angevin counts, till we reach the last and worst of
all, whose ruling passion seems to have been not ambition
but self-indulgence. Every former count of Anjou, from
Fulk the Red to Geoffrey Martel, had toiled and striven, and
sinned upon occasion, quite as much for his heirs as for himself:
Fulk Rechin toiled and sinned for himself alone. All
the thoroughness which they threw into the pursuit of their
house’s greatness he threw simply into the pursuit of his own
selfish desires. Had Geoffrey the Bearded possessed the
highest capacities, he could have done little for his own or
his country’s advancement while his brother’s restless intrigues
were sowing strife and discontent among the Angevin
baronage and turning the whole land into a hotbed of
treason.<a id="Anchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 509.">[509]</a> Geoffrey’s cause was however damaged by his own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220">220</a></span>
imprudence. An act of violent injustice to the abbey of
Marmoutier brought him under the ban of the Church;<a id="Anchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 510.">[510]</a> and
from that moment his ruin became certain. From within
and without, troubles crowded upon the Marchland and its
unhappy count. The comet which scared all Europe in 1066
was the herald of evil days to Anjou as well as to the land
with which she was one day to be linked so closely. In that
very year a Breton invasion was only checked by the sudden
death of Duke Conan just after he had received the surrender
of Châteaugonthier.<a id="Anchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 511.">[511]</a> Next spring, on the first Sunday
in Lent, Saumur was betrayed by its garrison to Fulk
Rechin;<a id="Anchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 512.">[512]</a> on the Wednesday before Easter he was treacherously
admitted into Angers, and Geoffrey fell with his
capital into the clutches of his brother.<a id="Anchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 513.">[513]</a> The citizens next
day rose in a body and slew the chief traitors;<a id="Anchor_514" href="#Footnote_514" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 514.">[514]</a> the disloyalty
of Saumur was punished by the duke of Aquitaine,
who profited by the distracted state of Anjou to cross the
border and fire the town;<a id="Anchor_515" href="#Footnote_515" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 515.">[515]</a> while the remonstrances of Pope
Alexander <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> soon compelled Fulk to release his brother.<a id="Anchor_516" href="#Footnote_516" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 516.">[516]</a>
Next year, however, Geoffrey was again taken prisoner while
besieging Fulk’s castle of Brissac.<a id="Anchor_517" href="#Footnote_517" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 517.">[517]</a> This time the king of
France, alarmed no doubt by the revelation of such a temper
among his vassals, took up arms for Geoffrey’s restoration,
and he was joined by Count Stephen of Blois, the son of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221">221</a></span>
Theobald from whom Geoffrey Martel had won Tours. Fulk
bought off both his assailants. Stephen, who was now
governing the territories of Blois as regent for his aged
father, was pacified by receiving Fulk’s homage for Touraine;
the king was bribed more unblushingly still, by the cession
of what was more undeniably Geoffrey’s lawful property than
any part of the Angevin dominions—his paternal heritage of
the Gâtinais.<a id="Anchor_518" href="#Footnote_518" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 518.">[518]</a> It thus became Philip’s interest as well as
Fulk’s to keep Geoffrey in prison. For the next twenty-eight
years he lay in a dungeon at Chinon,<a id="Anchor_519" href="#Footnote_519" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 519.">[519]</a> and Fulk ruled Anjou
in his stead.</p>

<p>That time was a time of shame and misery such as the
Marchland had never yet seen. Eight years of civil war had
fostered among the barons of Anjou and Touraine a spirit of
turbulence and lawlessness which Fulk, whose own intrigues
had sown the first seeds of the mischief, was powerless to
control. Throughout the whole of his reign, all southern
Touraine was kept in confusion by a feud among the landowners
at Amboise;<a id="Anchor_520" href="#Footnote_520" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 520.">[520]</a> and it can hardly have been the only
one of its kind under a ruler who, instead of putting it down
with a strong hand, only aggravated it by his undignified
and violent intermeddling. Nor were his foreign relations
better regulated than his home policy. For a moment, in
1073, an opportunity seemed to present itself of regaining
the lost Angevin overlordship over Maine. Ten years of
Angevin rule had failed to crush out the love of independence
among the Cenomannian people; ten years of Norman
rule had just as little effect. While their conqueror was busied
with the settlement of his later and greater conquest beyond
sea, the patriots of Maine seized a favourable moment to
throw off the Norman yoke. Hugh of Este or of Liguria,
a son of Herbert Wake-the-dog’s eldest daughter Gersendis,
was received as count under the guardianship of his mother
and Geoffrey of Mayenne. But Geoffrey, who in the hour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222">222</a></span>
of adversity ten years before had seemed little short of a
hero, yielded to the temptations of power; and his tyranny
drove the Cenomannians to fall back upon the traditions of
their old municipal freedom and “make a commune”—in
other words, to set up a civic commonwealth such as those
which were one day to be the glory of the more distant
Cenomannian land on the other side of the Alps. At Le
Mans, however, the experiment was premature. It failed
through the treachery of Geoffrey of Mayenne; and the
citizens, in the extremity of despair, called upon Fulk of
Anjou to save them at once from Geoffrey and from William.
Fulk readily helped them to dislodge Geoffrey from the
citadel of Le Mans;<a id="Anchor_521" href="#Footnote_521" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 521.">[521]</a> but as soon as William appeared in
Maine with a great army from over sea Fulk, like his uncle,
vanished. Only when the conqueror had “won back the
land of Maine”<a id="Anchor_522" href="#Footnote_522" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 522.">[522]</a> and returned in triumph to Normandy did
Fulk venture to attack La Flèche, a castle on the right bank
of the Loir, close to the Angevin border, and held by John,
husband of Herbert Wake-dog’s youngest daughter Paula.<a id="Anchor_523" href="#Footnote_523" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 523.">[523]</a>
At John’s request William sent a picked band of Norman
troops to reinforce the garrison of La Flèche; Fulk at once
collected all his forces and persuaded Hoel duke of Britanny to
bring a large Breton host to help him in besieging the place.
A war begun on such a scale as this might be nominally an
attack on John, but it was practically an attack on William.
He took it as such, and again calling together his forces,
Normans and English, led them down to the relief of La Flèche.
Instead, however, of marching straight to the spot, he crossed
the Loir higher up and swept round to the southward
through the territories of Anjou, thus putting the river
between himself and his enemies. The movement naturally
drew Fulk back across the river to defend his own land
against the Norman invader.<a id="Anchor_524" href="#Footnote_524" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 524.">[524]</a> The two armies drew up
facing each other on a wide moor or heath stretching along
the left bank of the Loir between La Flèche and Le Lude,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223">223</a></span>
and overgrown with white reindeer-moss, whence it took the
name of Blanchelande. No battle however took place;
some clergy who were happily at hand stepped in as mediators,
and after a long negotiation peace was arranged. The
count of Anjou again granted the investiture of Maine to
Robert of Normandy, and, like his predecessor, received the
young man’s homage to himself as overlord.<a id="Anchor_525" href="#Footnote_525" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 525.">[525]</a> Like the treaty
of Alençon, the treaty of Blanchelande was a mere formal
compromise; William kept it a dead letter by steadily refusing
to make over Maine to his son, and holding it as before
by the right of his own good sword. A few years later Fulk
succeeded in accomplishing his vengeance upon John of La
Flèche by taking and burning his castle;<a id="Anchor_526" href="#Footnote_526" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 526.">[526]</a> but the expedition
seems to have been a mere border-raid, and so long as
William lived neither native patriotism nor Angevin meddlesomeness
ventured again to question his supremacy over
Maine.</p>

<p>But on his death in 1087 the advantage really given to
Anjou by the treaties of Alençon and Blanchelande at last
became apparent. From the moment when Robert came
into actual possession of the fief with which he had been
twice invested by an Angevin count, the Angevin overlordship
could no longer be denied or evaded. The action of
the Cenomannians forced their new ruler to throw himself
upon Fulk’s support. Their unquenchable love of freedom
caught at the first ray of hope offered them by Robert’s
difficulties in his Norman duchy and quarrels with his
brother the king of England, and their attitude grew so
alarming that in 1089 Robert, lying sick at Rouen, sent for
the count of Anjou and in a personal interview besought
him to use his influence in preventing their threatened
revolt. Fulk consented, on condition that, as the price of
his good offices, Robert should obtain for him the hand of
a beautiful Norman lady, Bertrada of Montfort.<a id="Anchor_527" href="#Footnote_527" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 527.">[527]</a> Fulk’s
domestic life was as shameless as his public career. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
had already one wife dead and two living; Hermengard of
Bourbon, whom he had married in 1070<a id="Anchor_528" href="#Footnote_528" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 528.">[528]</a> and who was the
mother of his heir,<a id="Anchor_529" href="#Footnote_529" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 529.">[529]</a> had been abandoned in 1075 without
even the formality of a divorce for Arengard of Châtel-Aillon;<a id="Anchor_530" href="#Footnote_530" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 530.">[530]</a>
and Arengard was now set aside in her turn to
make way for Bertrada.<a id="Anchor_531" href="#Footnote_531" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 531.">[531]</a> These scandals had already
brought Fulk under a Papal sentence of excommunication;<a id="Anchor_532" href="#Footnote_532" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 532.">[532]</a>
he met with a further punishment at the hands of his new
bride. Bertrada used him simply as a stepping-stone to
higher advancement; on Whitsun-Eve 1093 she eloped
with King Philip of France.<a id="Anchor_533" href="#Footnote_533" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 533.">[533]</a></p>

<p>By that time Maine was again in revolt. The leader of
the rising was young Elias of La Flèche, a son of John and
Paula; but his place was soon taken by the veteran Geoffrey
of Mayenne, whose treasons seem to have been forgiven and
forgotten, and who now once more installed Hugh of Este
as count at Le Mans. Hugh proved however utterly unfit
for his honourable but dangerous position, and gladly sold
his claims to his cousin Elias.<a id="Anchor_534" href="#Footnote_534" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 534.">[534]</a> For nearly six years the
Cenomannians were free to rejoice in a ruler of their own

people had no need to praise him in words; for them he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225">225</a></span>
simply the incarnation of Cenomannian freedom; his
bright, warm-hearted, impulsive nature spoke for itself.
The strength as well as the charm of his character lay in
its perfect sincerity; its faults were as undisguised as
its virtues. In the gloomy tale of public wrong and
private vice which makes up the history of the time—the
time of Fulk Rechin, Philip <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> and William Rufus—the
only figure which shines out bright against the darkness,
except the figure of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Anselm himself, is that of
Count Elias of Maine.</p>

<p>During these years Anjou interfered with him as little
as Normandy; Fulk was overwhelmed with domestic and
ecclesiastical troubles. His excommunication was at length
removed in 1094;<a id="Anchor_536" href="#Footnote_536" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 536.">[536]</a> two years later Pope Urban <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, on
his way to preach the Crusade in western Gaul, was received
by the count at Angers and consecrated the abbey
church of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Nicolas, now at length brought to completion.<a id="Anchor_537" href="#Footnote_537" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 537.">[537]</a>
From Angers Urban passed to Tours and Le Mans; and
among the many hearts stirred by his call to take the cross
there can have been few more earnest than that of Elias of
Maine. Robert of Normandy was already gone, leaving his
dominions pledged to his brother the king of England.
Elias prepared to follow him; but when his request to
William Rufus for the protection due to a crusader’s lands
during his absence was met by a declaration of the Red
King’s resolve to regain all the territories which had been
held by his father, the count of Maine saw that he must
fight out his crusade not in Holy Land but at home. The
struggle had scarcely begun when he was taken prisoner by
Robert of Bellême, and sent in chains to the king at Rouen.<a id="Anchor_538" href="#Footnote_538" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 538.">[538]</a>
The people of Maine, whose political existence seemed bound<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226">226</a></span>
up in their count, were utterly crushed by his loss. But
there was another enemy to be faced. Aremburg, the only
child of Elias, was betrothed to Fulk Rechin’s eldest son,
Geoffrey,<a id="Anchor_539" href="#Footnote_539" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 539.">[539]</a> whose youthful valour had won him the surname of
“Martel the Second;” Geoffrey hurried to save the heritage
of his bride, and Fulk was no less eager to seize the opportunity
of asserting once more his rights to the overlordship
of Maine.<a id="Anchor_540" href="#Footnote_540" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 540.">[540]</a> The Cenomannians gladly welcomed the only
help that was offered them; and while Geoffrey reinforced
the garrison of Le Mans, Fulk tried to effect a diversion on
the border.<a id="Anchor_541" href="#Footnote_541" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 541.">[541]</a> But meanwhile Elias had guessed his design,
and frustrated it by making terms with the Norman.<a id="Anchor_542" href="#Footnote_542" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 542.">[542]</a> If
Maine must needs bow to a foreign yoke, even William
Rufus was at least a better master than Fulk Rechin. To
William, therefore, Elias surrendered his county as the price
of his own release;<a id="Anchor_543" href="#Footnote_543" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 543.">[543]</a> and to William he offered his services
with the trustful frankness of a heart to which malice was
unknown. The offer was refused. Then, from its very
ashes, the spirit of Cenomannian freedom rose up once more,
and for the second time Elias hurled his defiance at the Red
King. An Angevin count in William’s place would probably
have flung the bold speaker straight back into the
dungeon whence he had come; the haughty chivalry of the
Norman only bade him begone and do his worst.<a id="Anchor_544" href="#Footnote_544" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 544.">[544]</a> In the
spring Elias fought his way back to Le Mans, where the
people welcomed him with clamorous delight; William’s unexpected
approach, however, soon compelled him to withdraw;<a id="Anchor_545" href="#Footnote_545" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 545.">[545]</a>
and Maine had to wait two more years for her
deliverance. It came with the news of the Red King’s death
in August 1100. Robert of Normandy was too indolent,
Henry of England too wise, to answer the appeal for succour<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227">227</a></span>
made to each in turn by the Norman garrison of Le Mans;
Elias received their submission and sent them home in
peace;<a id="Anchor_546" href="#Footnote_546" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 546.">[546]</a> and thenceforth the foreign oppressor trod the soil
of Maine no more. When the final struggle for Normandy
broke out between Robert and Henry, Elias, with characteristic
good sense, commended himself to the one overlord
whom he saw to be worthy of his homage.<a id="Anchor_547" href="#Footnote_547" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 547.">[547]</a> Henry was
wise enough loyally to accept the service and the friendship
which Rufus had scorned; and he proved its value on the
field of Tinchebray, where Elias and his Cenomannians decided
the battle in his favour, and thus made him master of
Normandy. On the other hand, the dread of Angevin
tyranny had changed into a glad anticipation of peaceful
and equal union. The long battle of Cenomannian freedom,
so often baffled and so often renewed, was won at last.
When next a duke of Normandy disputed the possession
of Maine with a count of Anjou, he disputed it not with
a rival oppressor but with the husband of its countess,
the lawful heir of Elias; and the triumph of Cenomannia
received its fitting crown when Henry’s daughter
wedded Aremburg’s son in the minster of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Julian at Le
Mans.</p>

<p>The union of Anjou and Maine did not, however, come
to pass exactly as it had been first planned; Aremburg
became the wife of an Angevin count, but he was not
Geoffrey Martel the Second. That marriage, long deferred
by reason of the bride’s youth, was frustrated in the end by
the death of the bridegroom. His life had been far from an
easy one. Fulk, prematurely worn out by a life of vice, had
for some years past made over the cares of government to
Geoffrey.<a id="Anchor_548" href="#Footnote_548" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 548.">[548]</a> Father and son agreed as ill as their namesakes
in a past generation; but this time the fault was not on the
young man’s side. Geoffrey, while spending all his energies
in doing his father’s work, saw himself supplanted in that
father’s affection by his little half-brother, Bertrada’s child.
He found a friend in his unhappy uncle, Geoffrey the
Bearded, whose reason had been almost destroyed by half<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228">228</a></span>
a lifetime of captivity; and a touching story relates how the
imprisoned count in a lucid interval expressed his admiration
for his nephew’s character, and voluntarily renounced in his
favour the rights which he still persisted in maintaining
against Fulk.<a id="Anchor_549" href="#Footnote_549" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 549.">[549]</a> On the strength of this renunciation Geoffrey
Martel, backed by Pope Urban, at length extorted his
father’s consent to the liberation of the captive. It was,
however, too late to be of much avail; reason and health
were both alike gone, and all that the victim gained by his
nephew’s care was that, when he died shortly after, he at
least died a free man.<a id="Anchor_550" href="#Footnote_550" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 550.">[550]</a> His bequest availed as little to
Geoffrey Martel; in 1103, Fulk openly announced his intention
of disinheriting his valiant son in favour of Bertrada’s
child. A brief struggle, in which Fulk was backed by the
duke of Aquitaine and Geoffrey by Elias, ended in Fulk’s
abdication. For three years Geoffrey ruled well and prosperously,<a id="Anchor_551" href="#Footnote_551" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 551.">[551]</a>
till in May 1106, as he was besieging a rebellious
vassal in the castle of Candé on the Loire, he was struck by

perhaps carried her baby with her, or persuaded the weak count
to let her have him and bring him up at court; there, at
any rate, he was at the time of Geoffrey’s death. Philip
granted him the investiture of Anjou in Geoffrey’s stead, and
commissioned Duke William of Aquitaine, who happened to
be at court, to escort him safe home to his father. The
Poitevin, however, conveyed him away into his own
territories, and there put him in prison. Philip’s threats,
Bertrada’s persuasions, alike proved unavailing, till the boy’s
own father purchased his release by giving up some border-towns
to Poitou, and after a year’s captivity young Fulk at
last came home.<a id="Anchor_555" href="#Footnote_555" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 555.">[555]</a> Two years later, on April 14, 1109,

<p>“Ill he began; worse he lived; worst of all he ended.”<a id="Anchor_557" href="#Footnote_557" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 557.">[557]</a>
Such is the verdict of a later Angevin historian upon the
man whom we should have been glad to respect as the father
of Angevin history. Fulk Rechin’s utter worthlessness had
well-nigh undone the work of Geoffrey Martel and Fulk the
Black; amid the wreck of the Angevin power in his hands,
the only result of their labours which seemed still to remain
was the mere territorial advantage involved in the possession
of Touraine. Politically, Anjou had sunk far below the
position which she had held in the Black Count’s earliest
days; she had not merely ceased to be a match for the
greatest princes of the realm, she had ceased to be a power
in the realm at all. The title of count of Anjou, for nearly
a hundred years a very synonym of energy and progress, had
become identified with weakness and disgrace. The black
cloud of ruin seemed to be settling down over the marchland,
only waiting its appointed time to burst and pour upon her
its torrent of destruction. It proved to be only the dark
hour before the dawn of the brightest day that Anjou had
seen since her great Count Fulk was laid in his grave at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230">230</a></span>
Beaulieu—perhaps even since her good Count Fulk was laid
in his grave at Tours.</p>

<p>Nearly nine months before the death of Fulk Rechin,
Louis <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> had succeeded his father Philip as king of
France.<a id="Anchor_558" href="#Footnote_558" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 558.">[558]</a> His accession marks an era in the growth of the
French monarchy. It is a turning-point in the struggle of
the feudataries with the Crown, or rather with each other
for control over the Crown, which lay at the root of the
rivalry between Anjou and Blois, and which makes up almost
the whole history of the first three generations of the kingly
house founded by Hugh Capet. The royal authority was a
mere name; but that name was still the centre round which
the whole complicated system of French feudalism revolved;
it was the one point of cohesion among the various and ill-assorted
members which made up the realm of France, in the
wider sense which that word was now beginning to bear.
The duke or count of almost any one of the great fiefs—Normandy,
Flanders, Burgundy, Aquitaine—was far more
really powerful and independent than the king, who was
nominally the lord paramount of them all, but practically
the tool of each in turn. In this seemingly ignominious
position of the Crown there was, however, an element of hidden
strength which in the end enabled it to swallow up and outlive
all its rivals. The end was as yet far distant; but the
first step towards it was taken when Louis the Fat was
crowned at Reims in August 1109. At the age of thirty-two
he ascended the throne with a fixed determination to
secure such an absolute authority within the immediate
domains of the Crown as should enable him to become the
master instead of the servant of his feudataries.</p>

<p>This policy led almost of necessity to a conflict with
King Henry of England, who had now become master of
Normandy by his victory at Tinchebray. Louis appears
never to have received Henry’s homage for the duchy;<a id="Anchor_559" href="#Footnote_559" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 559.">[559]</a> and
it may have been to avoid the necessity of performing this
act of subordination that Henry, as it seems, refrained from
formally assuming the ducal title, at least so long as his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231">231</a></span>
captive brother lived.<a id="Anchor_560" href="#Footnote_560" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 560.">[560]</a> Whatever may have been his motive,
the fact aptly typifies his political position. Alike in French
and English eyes, he was a king of England ruling Normandy
as a dependency of the English Crown. Such a personage
was far more obnoxious to Louis and his projects than a
mere duke of the Normans, or even a duke of the Normans
ruling England as a dependency of the Norman duchy. On
the other hand, Henry, in the new position given him by
his conquest, had every reason to look with jealousy and
suspicion upon the growing power of France. The uncertain
relations between the two kings therefore soon took an openly
hostile turn. In 1110 a quarrel arose between them concerning
the ownership of the great border-fortress of Gisors.
They met near the spot, each at the head of an army;
but they parted again after wasting a day in fruitless recriminations
and empty challenges.<a id="Anchor_561" href="#Footnote_561" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 561.">[561]</a> Their jealousy was
quickened by a dispute, also connected with the possession of
a castle, between Louis and Henry’s nephew Theobald count
of Blois.<a id="Anchor_562" href="#Footnote_562" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 562.">[562]</a> Uncle and nephew made common cause against
their common enemy; but the strife had scarcely begun
when a further complication destined to be of far weightier
consequence, if not to France at least to England, arose
out of the position and policy of the young count of Anjou.</p>

<p>The accession of Fulk <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr>, no less than that of Louis
<abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr>, began a new era for his country. The two princes
were in some respects not unlike each other: each stands
out in marked contrast to his predecessor, and in Fulk’s case
the contrast is even more striking than in that of Louis, for
if little good was to be expected of the son of Philip <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>,
there might well be even less hope of the child of Fulk
Rechin and Bertrada. As a ruler and as a man, however,
young Fulk turned utterly aside from the evil ways of both
his parents.<a id="Anchor_563" href="#Footnote_563" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 563.">[563]</a> Yet he was an Angevin of the Angevins;
physically, he had the ruddy complexion inherited from the
first of his race and name;<a id="Anchor_564" href="#Footnote_564" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 564.">[564]</a> while in his restless, adventurous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232">232</a></span>
temper, at once impetuous and wary, daring and discreet, he
shows a strong likeness to his great-grandfather Fulk the
Black. But the old fiery spirit breaks out in Fulk <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr> only
as if to remind us that it is still there, to shew that the
demon-blood of Anjou still flows in his veins, hot as ever
indeed, but kept under subjection to higher influences; the
sense of right that only woke now and then to torture the
conscience of the Black Count seems to be the guiding
principle of his great-grandson’s life. The evil influences
which must have surrounded his boyhood, whether it had
been passed in his father’s house, or, as seems more probable,
in the court of Philip and Bertrada, seem, instead of developing
the worse tendencies of his nature, only to have brought
out the better ones into more active working by sheer force
of opposition. Politically, however, there can be no doubt
that the peculiar circumstances of his early life led to important
results, by reviving and strengthening the old ties
between Anjou and the Crown which had somewhat slackened
in Fulk Rechin’s days. The most trusted counsellor of the
new king, the devoted supporter and not unfrequently the
instigator of his schemes of reform or of aggression, was
Almeric of Montfort, the brother of Bertrada. She herself,
after persecuting Louis by every means in her power so long
as his father lived, changed her policy as soon as he mounted
the throne and became as useful an ally as she had been a
dangerous enemy. Almeric’s influence, won by his own
talents, seems to have been almost all-powerful with the
king; over the count of Anjou, far younger and utterly
inexperienced, natural ties had given a yet more complete
ascendency to him and his sister, Fulk’s own mother. Their
policy was to pledge Anjou irrevocably to the side of the
French crown by forcing it into a quarrel with Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr></p>

<p>The means lay ready to their hands. Aremburg of
Maine, once the plighted bride of Geoffrey Martel, was still
unwed; Fulk, by his mother’s counsel, sought and won her
for his wife.<a id="Anchor_565" href="#Footnote_565" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 565.">[565]</a> Her marriage crowned the work of Elias.
The patriot-count’s mission was fulfilled, his task was done;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
and in that very summer he passed to his well-earned rest.<a id="Anchor_566" href="#Footnote_566" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 566.">[566]</a>
Fulk, as husband of the heiress, thus became count of Maine,
and the immediate consequence was a breach with Henry
on the long-vexed question of the overlordship of the county.
Whether Elias had or had not recognized any right of
overlordship in Fulk Rechin or Geoffrey Martel <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> is not
clear; he certainly seems to have done homage to Henry,<a id="Anchor_567" href="#Footnote_567" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 567.">[567]</a>
and their mutual relations as lord and vassal were highly
honourable to both; but it was hardly to be expected that
Fulk, whose predecessors had twice received the homage of
Henry’s elder brother for that very county, should yield up
without a struggle the rights of the count of Anjou. He
refused all submission to Henry, and at once formed a league
with the French Crown in active opposition to the lord of
England and Normandy.</p>

<p>The war began in 1111, and the danger was great
enough to call Henry himself over sea in August and keep
him on the continent for nearly two years. The leading
part was taken by the count of Anjou, whose marriage
enabled him to add the famous “Cenomannian swords” to
the forces of Touraine and the Angevin March.<a id="Anchor_568" href="#Footnote_568" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 568.">[568]</a> Moreover,
treason was, as usual, rife among the Norman barons; and
the worst of all the traitors was Robert of Bellême. One
after another the lesser offenders were brought to justice; at
last, in November 1112, Robert himself fell into the hands
of his outraged sovereign, and, to the joy of all men on both
sides of the sea, was flung into a lifelong captivity.<a id="Anchor_569" href="#Footnote_569" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 569.">[569]</a> Then
at last Henry felt secure in Normandy; the capture of
Robert was followed by the surrender of his fortress of
Alençon, and the tide of fortune turned so rapidly that Fulk
and Louis were soon compelled to sue for peace. Early in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234">234</a></span>
Lent 1113 Fulk and Henry met at Pierre-Pécoulée near
Alençon; the count submitted to perform the required
homage for Maine, and his infant daughter was betrothed to
Henry’s son, the little Ætheling William. In March the
treaty was confirmed by the two kings at Gisors; and as
the first-fruits of their new alliance there was seen the
strange spectacle of a count of Anjou and a count of Blois
fighting side by side to help the lord of Normandy in
subduing the rebels who still held out in the castle of
Bellême.<a id="Anchor_570" href="#Footnote_570" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 570.">[570]</a></p>

<p>Henry’s next step was to exact, first from the barons of
Normandy and then from the Great Council of England, a
solemn oath of homage and fealty to his son William as his
destined successor.<a id="Anchor_571" href="#Footnote_571" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 571.">[571]</a> This ceremony, not unusual in France,
but quite without precedent in England, was doubtless a
precaution against the chances of the war which he foresaw
must soon be renewed. This time indeed he was himself
the aggressor; Louis had made no hostile movement, and
Fulk was troubled by a revolt at home, whose exact nature
is not clearly ascertained. The universal tendency of feudal
vassals to rebel against their lord had probably something
to do with it; but there seems also to have been another
and a far more interesting element at work. “There arose
a grave dissension between Count Fulk the Younger and
the burghers of Angers.”<a id="Anchor_572" href="#Footnote_572" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 572.">[572]</a> In this provokingly brief entry
in one of the Angevin chronicles we may perhaps catch a
glimpse of that new spirit of civic freedom which was just
springing into life in northern Europe, and which made some
progress both in France and in England during the reigns
of Louis <abbr title="the Sixth">VI.</abbr> and Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> One would gladly know what
were the demands of the Angevin burghers, and how they
were met by the son-in-law of Elias of Le Mans; but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235">235</a></span>
faint echo of the dispute between count and citizens is
drowned in the roar of the more imposing strife which soon
broke out anew between the rival kings. Its ostensible
cause was now Count Theobald of Blois, whose wrongs were
made by his uncle a ground for marching into France, in
company with Theobald himself and his brother Stephen, in
the spring of 1116. Louis retaliated by a raid upon Normandy;
the Norman barons recommenced their old intrigues;<a id="Anchor_573" href="#Footnote_573" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 573.">[573]</a>
and they were soon furnished with an excellent pretext.
After the battle of Tinchebray, Duke Robert’s infant son
William had been intrusted by his victorious uncle to the
care of his half-sister’s husband, Elias of Saint-Saëns. Elias
presently began to suspect Henry of evil designs against the
child; at once, sacrificing his own possessions to Henry’s
wrath, he fled with his charge and led him throughout all
the neighbouring lands, seeking to stir up sympathy for the
fugitive heir of Normandy, till he found him a shelter at the
court of his kinsman Count Baldwin of Flanders.<a id="Anchor_574" href="#Footnote_574" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 574.">[574]</a> At last
the faithful guardian’s zeal was rewarded by seeing the cause
of his young brother-in-law taken up by both Baldwin and
Louis. In 1117 they leagued themselves together with the
avowed object of avenging Duke Robert and reinstating his
son in the duchy of Normandy; and their league was at
once joined by the count of Anjou.<a id="Anchor_575" href="#Footnote_575" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 575.">[575]</a></p>

<p>The quarrel had now assumed an aspect far more
threatening to Henry; but it was not till the middle of the
following summer that the war began in earnest. Its first
honours were won by the count of Anjou, in the capture of
La Motte-Gautier, a fortress on the Cenomannian border.<a id="Anchor_576" href="#Footnote_576" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 576.">[576]</a>
In September the count of Flanders was mortally wounded
in a skirmish near Eu;<a id="Anchor_577" href="#Footnote_577" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 577.">[577]</a> Louis and Fulk had however more
useful allies in the Norman baronage, whose chiefs were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236">236</a></span>
nearly all either openly or secretly in league with them.
Almeric of Montfort, who claimed the county of Evreux,
was the life and soul of all their schemes. In October the
city of Evreux was betrayed into his hands;<a id="Anchor_578" href="#Footnote_578" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 578.">[578]</a> and this
disaster was followed by another at Alençon. Henry had
granted the lands of Robert of Bellême to Theobald of
Blois; Theobald, with his uncle’s permission, made them
over to his brother Stephen; and Stephen at once began to
shew in his small dominions the same incapacity for keeping
order which he shewed afterwards on a larger scale in
England. His negligence brought matters at Alençon to
such a pass that the outraged citizens called in the help of
the count of Anjou, admitted him and his troops by night
into the town, and joined with him in blockading the castle.<a id="Anchor_579" href="#Footnote_579" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 579.">[579]</a>
Stephen meanwhile had joined his uncle and brother at
Séez. On receipt of the evil tidings, the two young counts
hurried back to Alençon, made an unsuccessful attempt to
revictual the garrison, and then tried to surround the Angevin
camp, which had been pitched in a place called “the Park.”
A long day’s fighting, in which the tide seems to have been
turned at last chiefly by the valour of Fulk himself, ended
in an Angevin victory and won him the surrender of Alençon.<a id="Anchor_580" href="#Footnote_580" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 580.">[580]</a></p>

<p>The following year was for Henry an almost unbroken
series of reverses and misfortunes, and in 1119 he was compelled
to seek peace with Fulk. Their treaty was ratified in
June by the marriage of William the Ætheling and Matilda
of Anjou; Fulk made an attempt to end the Cenomannian
difficulty by settling Maine upon his daughter as a marriage-portion,<a id="Anchor_581" href="#Footnote_581" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 581.">[581]</a>
and gave up Alençon on condition that Henry
should restore it to the dispossessed heir, William Talvas.<a id="Anchor_582" href="#Footnote_582" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 582.">[582]</a>
Henry had now to face only the French king and the traitor
barons. With the latter he began at once by firing the town<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237">237</a></span>
of Evreux.<a id="Anchor_583" href="#Footnote_583" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 583.">[583]</a> Louis, on receiving these tidings from Almeric
of Montfort, assembled his troops at Etampes and marched
upon Normandy. In the plain of Brenneville, between
Noyon and Andely, he was met by Henry with the flower of
his English and Norman forces. Louis, in the insane
bravado of chivalry, disdained to get his men into order
before beginning the attack, and he thereby lost the day.
The first charge, made by eighty French knights under a
Norman traitor, William Crispin, broke against the serried
ranks of the English fighting on foot around their king; all
the eighty were surrounded and made prisoners; and the
rest of the French army was put to such headlong flight
that, if the Norman tale can be true, out of nine hundred
knights only three were found dead on the field. Louis himself,
unhorsed in the confusion, escaped alone into a wood
where he lost his way, and was finally led back to Andely
by a peasant ignorant of his rank.<a id="Anchor_584" href="#Footnote_584" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 584.">[584]</a> In bitter shame he
went home to Paris to seek comfort and counsel of Almeric,
who, luckily for both, had had no share in this disastrous
expedition. By Almeric’s advice a summons was issued to
all bishops, counts, and other persons in authority throughout
the realm, bidding them stir up their people, on pain of
anathema, to come and help the king. The plan seems to
have had much the same result as a calling-out of the
“<span lang="ang" xml:lang="ang">fyrd</span>” in England, and the host which it brought together
inflicted terrible ravages upon Normandy. In October
Louis sought help in another quarter. Pope Calixtus had
come to hold a council at Reims; the ecclesiastical business
ended, he had to listen to a string of appeals in all sorts of
causes, and the first appellant was the king of France, who
came before the Pope in person and set forth a detailed list
of complaints against Henry. The archbishop of Rouen
rose to defend his sovereign, but the council refused to hear
him. Calixtus, however, was on too dangerous terms with
Henry of Germany to venture upon anathematizing his
father-in-law, Henry of England; and in a personal interview<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238">238</a></span>
at Gisors, in November, the English king vindicated himself
to the Pope’s complete satisfaction. The tide had turned
once more. Almeric had been won over by a grant of the
coveted honour of Evreux; and his defection from Louis was
followed by that of all the other rebel Normans in rapid
succession. William the Clito—as Duke Robert’s son is
called, to distinguish him from his cousin William the
Ætheling—was again driven into exile, with his faithful
brother-in-law still at his side; a treaty was arranged between
Henry and Louis; all castles were to be restored, all
captives freed, and all wrongs forgiven and forgotten.<a id="Anchor_585" href="#Footnote_585" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 585.">[585]</a></p>

<p>We seem to be reading the story of Fulk Nerra over again
as we are told how his great-grandson, as soon as peace
seemed assured and he was reconciled to all his neighbours,
desired also by penance for his sins to become reconciled to
God, and leaving his dominions in charge of his wife and
their two little sons, set out on pilgrimage to Jerusalem.<a id="Anchor_586" href="#Footnote_586" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 586.">[586]</a>
The “lord of three cities,”<a id="Anchor_587" href="#Footnote_587" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 587.">[587]</a> however, could not leave his territories
to take care of themselves as the Black Count seems
to have done; the regency of his boys was merely nominal,
for the eldest of them was but seven years old; and though
their mother, the daughter of Elias, may well have been a
wise and courageous woman, it was no light matter thus to
leave her alone with the rival kings on each side of her. To
guard against all dangers, therefore, Fulk again formally
commended the county of Maine to King Henry as overlord
during his own life, and bequeathed it to his son-in-law
the Ætheling in case he should not return.<a id="Anchor_588" href="#Footnote_588" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 588.">[588]</a> Two months
before his departure, the cathedral of Le Mans, which had
just been rebuilt, was consecrated in his presence and that of
his wife. At the close of the ceremony he took up his little
son Geoffrey in his arms and placed him on the altar, saying<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239">239</a></span>
with tears: “O holy Julian, to thee I commend my child and
my land, that thou mayest be the defender and protector of
both!”<a id="Anchor_589" href="#Footnote_589" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 589.">[589]</a> The yearning which drew him literally to tread in
his great-grandfather’s steps was too strong to be repressed;
but he went,<a id="Anchor_590" href="#Footnote_590" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 590.">[590]</a> it is clear, with anxious and gloomy forebodings;
and before he reached his home again those forebodings
were fulfilled. The treaty that had promised so well was
scattered to the winds on November 25, 1120, by the death
of William the Ætheling in the wreck of the White Ship.<a id="Anchor_591" href="#Footnote_591" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 591.">[591]</a></p>

<p>In that wreck perished not merely Fulk’s hopes for the
settlement of Maine, but Henry’s hopes for the settlement of
England and Normandy. Setting aside the father’s personal
grief for the loss of his favourite child, the Ætheling’s death
was the most terrible political blow that could have fallen
upon Henry. All his hopes for the continuance of his work
were bound up in the life of his son. The toils and struggles
of twenty years would be little more than lost labour unless
he could guard against two dangers which had been the bane
of both England and Normandy ever since the Conqueror’s
death<span class="nobreak">:—</span>a disputed succession to the English throne, and a
separation between the insular and the continental dominions
of the ducal house. In the person of William the Ætheling
both dangers seemed provided against; if Henry lived but
a few years more, there was every reason to expect that
William, and William alone among the Conqueror’s surviving
descendants, would be able to mount the English throne without
opposition. On any accepted principle, his only possible
competitor would have been his cousin and namesake the
Clito. Neither people nor barons would have been likely to
think for a moment of setting aside the son of their crowned
king and queen—a king born in the land and a queen who
represented the ancient blood-royal of England—for a landless,
homeless stranger whose sole claim rested on the fact
that by strict rule of primogeniture he was the heir male of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240">240</a></span>
the Conqueror; and, once master of England, William might
fairly be expected to keep his hold upon Normandy as his
father had done. The shipwreck of November 1120, however,
left Henry suddenly face to face with the almost certain
prospect of being succeeded in all his dominions by his
brother’s son, his enemy, the rival of his lost boy, the one
person of all others whose succession would be most repugnant
alike to his feelings and to his policy. As soon as
Henry himself was gone, the Clito would have positively no
competitor; for of all Henry’s surviving children, the only
one who had any legal rights was a daughter. The future
of Henry’s policy had hung upon the thread of a single life,
and now the silver cord was loosed.</p>

<p>The Ætheling’s child-widow was in England: on that
sad night she had crossed with her father-in-law instead of
her husband, and thus escaped sharing the latter’s fate.
Fulk at once sent to demand his daughter back;<a id="Anchor_592" href="#Footnote_592" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 592.">[592]</a> but
Henry was unwilling to part from her, and kept her constantly
with him as if she were his own child, till the little
girl herself begged to see her own parents again, and was
allowed to return to Angers.<a id="Anchor_593" href="#Footnote_593" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 593.">[593]</a> Henry seems really to have
clung to her as a sort of legacy from his dead son; but, to
Fulk’s great indignation, he kept her dowry as well as herself.<a id="Anchor_594" href="#Footnote_594" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 594.">[594]</a>
An embassy sent to England at Christmas 1122—apparently
after her return to Anjou—came back without
success after a delay of several months and a stormy parting
from the king.<a id="Anchor_595" href="#Footnote_595" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 595.">[595]</a> The most important part of the dowry
however was still in Fulk’s own hands. His settlement of
Maine upon William and Matilda and their possible posterity
was annulled by William’s death; Fulk was once more free
to dispose of the county as he would. Regarding all ties
with Henry as broken, and urged at once by Almeric of
Montfort and Louis of France, he offered it, with the hand
of his second daughter Sibyl, to William the Clito.<a id="Anchor_596" href="#Footnote_596" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 596.">[596]</a></p>

<p>To the threatening attitude of France and Anjou was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241">241</a></span>
added, as a natural consequence, a conspiracy among the
Norman barons, headed by the arch-plotter Almeric and the
young Count Waleran of Meulan, a son of Henry’s own
familiar friend. Their scheme, planned at a meeting held
in September at the Croix-Saint-Leuffroy, was discovered
by the king; he marched at once upon Waleran’s castle of
Pontaudemer, and took it after a six weeks’ siege, during
which he worked in the trenches as hard as any young
soldier. This success was counterbalanced by the loss of
Gisors, which was taken and sacked by Almeric; Henry
retaliated by seizing Evreux. Advent and a stormy winter
checked the strife; one battle in the spring put an end to it.
On March 25, 1124, the rebels were met at Bourgthéroulde
by Ralf of Bayeux, who commanded at Evreux for King
Henry; despite their superior numbers, they were completely
defeated, and Waleran was taken prisoner.<a id="Anchor_597" href="#Footnote_597" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 597.">[597]</a> His capture
was followed by the surrender of his castles; Almeric, who
had as usual escaped, again made his peace with Henry; and
the Clito’s cause, forsaken by his Norman partizans, was left
almost wholly dependent on the support of Anjou.<a id="Anchor_598" href="#Footnote_598" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 598.">[598]</a> Meanwhile
Henry had found an ally in his son-in-law and namesake
the Emperor, and in August France was threatened
with a German invasion. Louis seized the consecrated
banner—the famous Oriflamme—which hung above the
high altar in the abbey of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Denis, and hurried off with it,
as Geoffrey Martel had once ridden forth with the standard
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin of Tours, to meet the foe. But the invasion
came to an unexpected end. For some reason which is not
explained, the Emperor turned suddenly homeward without
striking a blow.<a id="Anchor_599" href="#Footnote_599" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 599.">[599]</a></p>

<p>The English king found a more useful friend in the
Pope than in the Emperor. By dint of threats, promises
and bribes, he persuaded the court of Rome to annul the
marriage of Sibyl and the Clito on the ground of consanguinity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242">242</a></span>.<a id="Anchor_600" href="#Footnote_600" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 600.">[600]</a>
Of their kinship there is no doubt;<a id="Anchor_601" href="#Footnote_601" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 601.">[601]</a> but it was
in exactly the same degree as the kinship between Henry’s
own son and Sibyl’s sister, to whose marriage no objection
had ever been raised. The Clito refused to give up his
bride, and was thereupon excommunicated by the Pope;<a id="Anchor_602" href="#Footnote_602" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 602.">[602]</a>
Fulk publicly burnt the letter in which the legate insisted
upon the dissolution of the marriage, singed the beards of
the envoys who carried it, and put them in prison for a
fortnight. The consequence was an interdict<a id="Anchor_603" href="#Footnote_603" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 603.">[603]</a> which compelled
him to submit; the new-married couple parted, and
William the Clito became a wanderer once more.<a id="Anchor_604" href="#Footnote_604" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 604.">[604]</a></p>

<p>Next Christmas Henry struck his final blow at his nephew’s
hopes of the succession. An old tradition which declared
that whatsoever disturber of the realm of France was brought
face to face with the might of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Denis would die within a
twelvemonth was fulfilled in the person of the Emperor
Henry <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr><a id="Anchor_605" href="#Footnote_605" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 605.">[605]</a> His widow, the only surviving child of Henry
of England and the “Good Queen Maude,” was summoned
back to her father’s court.<a id="Anchor_606" href="#Footnote_606" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 606.">[606]</a> She came not without regret,
for she had dwelt from childhood among her husband’s
people, and was held by them in great esteem. The dying
Emperor had no child to take his place. He had committed
his sceptre to his consort;<a id="Anchor_607" href="#Footnote_607" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 607.">[607]</a> and some of the princes
of Lombardy and Lorraine took this symbolical bequest in

demand her back as their sovereign.<a id="Anchor_608" href="#Footnote_608" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 608.">[608]</a> But King Henry had
other plans for his daughter. At the midwinter assembly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243">243</a></span>
of 1126–1127 he made the barons and prelates of England
swear that in case of his death without lawful son they
would acknowledge her as Lady of England and Normandy.<a id="Anchor_609" href="#Footnote_609" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 609.">[609]</a></p>

<p>The first result of this unprecedented step was that the
king of France set himself to thwart it by again taking up
the cause of William the Clito, offering him, as compensation
for the loss of Sibyl and Maine, a grant of the French Vexin
and a bride whom not even Rome could make out to be his
cousin—Jane of Montferrat, half-sister to Louis’s own queen.<a id="Anchor_610" href="#Footnote_610" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 610.">[610]</a>
Two months later the count of Flanders was murdered at
Bruges. He was childless; the king of France adjudged
his fief to William the Clito as great-grandson of Count
Baldwin <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr>, and speedily put him in possession of the greater
part of the county.<a id="Anchor_611" href="#Footnote_611" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 611.">[611]</a> Henry’s daring scheme now seemed
all but hopeless. His only chance was to make peace with
some one at least of his adversaries; and the one whom he
chose was not the king of France, but the count of Anjou.
He saw—and Fulk saw it too—that until the question about
Maine was settled there could be no lasting security, and
that it could only be settled effectually by the union of all
conflicting claims in a single hand. For such an union the
way was now clear. The heir of Anjou was growing up to
manhood; the chosen successor of Henry was a childless
widow. Regardless of his promise not to give his daughter
in marriage to any one out of the realm<a id="Anchor_612" href="#Footnote_612" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 612.">[612]</a>—regardless of the
scorn of both Normans and English,<a id="Anchor_613" href="#Footnote_613" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 613.">[613]</a> of the Empress’s own
reluctance,<a id="Anchor_614" href="#Footnote_614" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 614.">[614]</a> and also of the kindred between the houses of
Normandy and Anjou—Henry sent Matilda over sea shortly
after Pentecost 1127 under the care of her half-brother Earl
Robert of Gloucester and Count Brian of Britanny, who were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244">244</a></span>
charged with instructions to the archbishop of Rouen to
make arrangements for her marriage with Geoffrey Plantagenet,
eldest son of the count of Anjou. In the last week
of August the king himself followed them;<a id="Anchor_615" href="#Footnote_615" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 615.">[615]</a> at the following
Whitsuntide he knighted Geoffrey at Rouen with his own
hand;<a id="Anchor_616" href="#Footnote_616" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 616.">[616]</a> and eight days later Geoffrey and Matilda were
wedded by the bishop of Avranches in the cathedral church

<p>It was a triumphant day for Fulk; but more triumphant
still was the day when he and Geoffrey brought the new
countess home to Angers. A large part of the barons and
prelates who filled <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Julian’s minster on the wedding-day
were Normans who in their inmost souls viewed with
mingled rage and shame what they held to be the degradation
of the Norman ducal house; a large part of the crowd who
with their lips cheered the bridal procession as it passed
through the streets of Le Mans were all the while cursing
in their hearts the Angevin foe of Normandy.<a id="Anchor_618" href="#Footnote_618" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 618.">[618]</a> But in
Fulk’s own capital the rejoicings were universal and unalloyed.
Many a brilliant match had been made by the
house of Anjou, from that wedding with the heiress of
Amboise which had been the beginning of its founder’s
fortunes, down to Fulk’s own marriage, only seventeen years
ago, with Aremburg of Maine; but never before had Black
Angers welcomed such a bride as King Henry’s daughter.
A writer of the next generation has left us a picture of
Angers as it was in his days—days when the son of Geoffrey
and Matilda was king of England and count of Anjou. In
its main features that picture is almost as true a likeness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245">245</a></span>
now as it can have been seven hundred years ago, and by its
help we can easily recall the scene of the bride’s homecoming.
We can see the eager citizens swarming along the
narrow, crooked streets that furrow the steep hill-side;—the
clergy in their richest vestments assembling from every
church in what is still, as it was then, emphatically a city of
churches, and mustering probably on the very summit of the
hill, in the open space before the cathedral—not the
cathedral whose white twin spires now soar above all things
around, the centre and the crown of Angers, but its Romanesque
predecessor, crowned doubtless by a companion
rather than a rival to the neighbouring dark tower of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Aubin’s abbey, which now contrasts so vividly with the
light pinnacles of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Maurice. Thence, at a given signal, the
procession streamed down with lighted tapers and waving
banners to the northern gate of the city, and with psalms
and hymns of rejoicing, half drowned in the shouting of the
people and the clang of the bells overhead, led the new
countess to her dwelling in the hall of Fulk the Black. It
was Fulk who had made the first rude plans for the edifice
of statesmanship which had now all but reached its last and
loftiest stage. The unconscious praise of the Black Count
was in every shout which beneath his palace-windows hailed
in the person of his worthiest namesake and descendant the
triumph of the house of Anjou.</p>

<p>There was no mother to welcome Geoffrey and his bride;
Aremburg had not lived to see the marriage of her son;<a id="Anchor_619" href="#Footnote_619" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 619.">[619]</a> and
now the shadow of another coming separation fell over the
mutual congratulations of Fulk and of his people. Another
royal father besides Henry was seeking an Angevin bridegroom
for his daughter and an Angevin successor to his
throne. It was now just thirty years since the acclamations
of the crusading host had chosen Godfrey of Bouillon king
of Jerusalem. The crown, which he in his humility declined<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246">246</a></span>
to wear, passed after his death to his brother Baldwin of
Edessa, and then to another Baldwin, of the noble family of
Réthel in Champagne. After a busy reign of ten years,
Baldwin <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, having no son, grew anxious to find a suitable
husband for his eldest daughter and destined heiress,
Melisenda. In the spring of 1128, with the unanimous
approval of his subjects, he offered her hand, together with
his crown, to Count Fulk of Anjou.<a id="Anchor_620" href="#Footnote_620" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 620.">[620]</a> He could not have
chosen a fitter man. Fulk was in the prime of life,<a id="Anchor_621" href="#Footnote_621" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 621.">[621]</a> young
enough to bring to his task all the vigour and energy needful
to withstand the ever-encroaching Infidels, yet old enough
to have learned political caution and experience; and if the
one qualification was needed for defence against external
foes, the other was no less so for steering a safe course amid
the endless jealousies of the Frank princes in Palestine.
Moreover, Fulk was known in the East by something more
than reputation. Free of all connexion with the internal
disputes of the realm, he was yet no utter stranger who
would come thither as a mere foreign interloper. He had
dwelt there for a whole year as a guest and a friend, and the
memory of his visit had been kept alive in the minds of the
people of the land, as well as in his own, by a yearly contribution
which, amid all his cares and necessities at home,
he had never failed to send to the Knights of the Temple
for the defence of the Holy City.<a id="Anchor_622" href="#Footnote_622" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 622.">[622]</a> Baldwin had thus every
inducement to make the offer; and Fulk had equally good
reasons for accepting it. His was clearly no case of mere
vulgar longing after a crown. There may have been a
natural feeling that it would be well to put Geoffrey’s father
on a titular level with Matilda’s; if the prophecy said to
have been made to Fulk the Good was already in circulation,
there may have been also a feeling that it was rapidly
approaching its fulfilment. But every recorded act of Fulk
<abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr> shews that he was too practical in temper to be dazzled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247">247</a></span>
by the mere glitter of a crown, without heeding the solid
advantages to be gained with it or to be given up for its
sake. He must have known that the sacred border-land of
Christendom and Islam was a much harder post to defend
than the marchland of France and Aquitaine had ever been;
he must have known that the consort of the queen of Jerusalem
would find little rest upon her throne. But this
second Count Fulk the Palmer cared for rest as little as the
first. It was work that he longed for: and work at home
was at an end for him. The mission of the counts of
Anjou, simply as such, was accomplished; when the heir of
the Marchland wedded the Lady-elect of Normandy and
England, he entered upon an entirely new phase of political
existence. Fulk had in fact, by marrying his son to the
Empress, cut short his own career, and left himself no choice
but to submit to complete effacement or seek a new sphere
of action elsewhere. Had Baldwin’s proposal come a year
earlier, it might have caused a struggle between inclination
and duty; coming as it did just after Henry’s, it extricated
all parties from their last difficulty.</p>

<p>Fulk could not, however, accept the proposal without the
consent of his overlord King Louis and that of his own
subjects.<a id="Anchor_623" href="#Footnote_623" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 623.">[623]</a> Both were granted; his people had prospered
under him, but they, too, doubtless saw that alike for him
and for them it was time to part. On that same Whit-Sunday
when young Geoffrey was knighted at Rouen by
King Henry, his father, prostrate before the high altar in the

Archbishop Hildebert.<a id="Anchor_624" href="#Footnote_624" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 624.">[624]</a> From the wedding festivities at Le
Mans he came home to make his preparations for departure.
It may be that once more in the old hall overlooking the
Mayenne the barons of Anjou and Touraine gathered round
the last Count Fulk, to be solemnly released from their
allegiance to him, and to perform their homage to his successor.
A more secluded spot was chosen for the last family
meeting. A few miles south-east of Saumur, in the midst of
dark woods and fruitful apple-orchards, a pious and noble<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248">248</a></span>
crusader, Robert of Arbrissel, had founded in the early years
of Fulk’s reign the abbey of Fontevraud, whose church has
counted ever since among the architectural marvels of
western Europe. An English visitor now-a-days feels as if
some prophetic instinct must have guided its architect and
given to his work that peculiar awe-striking character which
so exactly fits it for the burial-place of the two Angevin
kings of England whose sculptured effigies still remain in
its south transept. The first of their race who wore a crown,
however, came thither not for his last sleep, but only for a
few hours of rest ere he started on his eastward journey.
The monastery was a double one—half for men and half for
women; in the latter Fulk’s eldest daughter, the widow of
William the Ætheling, had lately taken the veil. The
cloisters of Fontevraud offered a quiet refuge where father
and children could all meet undisturbed to exchange their
last farewells.<a id="Anchor_625" href="#Footnote_625" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 625.">[625]</a> Before Whitsuntide came round again Fulk
and Anjou had parted for ever.<a id="Anchor_626" href="#Footnote_626" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 626.">[626]</a></p>

The Angevin spirit of restless activity and sleepless vigilance,
of hard-working thoroughness and indomitable perseverance,
never, perhaps, shewed to better advantage than in this
second half of the eventful life of Fulk of Jerusalem; but we
have to trace its workings only as they influenced the history
of our own land. Our place is not with the devoted personal
followers who went with Fulk across land and sea, but with
those who stayed to share the fortunes of his successor in
Anjou. Our concern is with the father of the Angevin
kings, not of Jerusalem, but of England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249">249</a></span></p>


<p>All historians are agreed that Geoffrey the Bearded and Fulk
Rechin were sons of Geoffrey Martel’s sister and of a count (or viscount)
of Gâtinais, or Châteaulandon, which is the same thing—the
Gâtinais being a district on the north-eastern border of the Orléanais
whereof Châteaulandon was the capital. But the names of both
husband and wife differ in different accounts. Fulk Rechin
    (<cite>Marchegay,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 375</cite>) calls his mother Hermengard; <abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Ralf de Diceto">R. Diceto</abbr>
    (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 333</cite>;

    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta
<abbr title="Consulum">Cons.</abbr></i></cite>
no names are given. If we could be sure that Fulk really
wrote the fragment which bears his name, his testimony would of
course be decisive; as it is, we are left in doubt. The point is one
of trifling importance, for whatever the lady’s name may have been,
there is no doubt that she was the daughter of Fulk the Black and
Hildegard. But who was her husband?</p>

<p>First, as to his name. The
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta <abbr title="Consulum">Cons.</abbr></i></cite>
do not mention it. The

Rechin (as above) calls him Geoffrey. None of them tell us anything
about him. It seems in fact to be the aim of the Angevin
writers to keep us in the dark as to the descent of the later counts
of Anjou from the house of Gâtinais through the husband of
Hermengard-Adela; but they try to make out a connexion between
the two families six generations further back. One of the earliest
legends in the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta <abbr title="Consulum">Cons.</abbr></i> (Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 39–45)</cite>
tells how
Châteaulandon and the Gâtinais were given to Ingelger as a reward
for his defence of his slandered godmother, the daughter and
heiress of a Count Geoffrey of Gâtinais, and the alleged gift is
coupled with a grant from the king of the viscounty of Orléans.
What Ingelger may or may not have held it is impossible to say, as
we really know nothing about him. But there is proof that the
viscounty of Orléans at least did not pass to his descendants. The
very first known charter of Fulk the Good, one dated May 942, is
witnessed by Geoffrey viscount of Orléans; and Geoffrey Greygown’s
charter for the reform of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Aubin’s in 966 is witnessed by Alberic
viscount of Gâtinais, whose signature has already appeared in 957,
attached to a charter of Theobald the Trickster. This Alberic may
very likely have been the son of his predecessor Geoffrey, but he
cannot well have been the father of Fulk Nerra’s son-in-law; there
is a generation dropped out, and of the man who should fill it the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250">250</a></span>
only trace is in
    <cite>Ménage (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Histoire">Hist.</abbr> de Sablé</i>)</cite>,
who says that Fulk Rechin’s
father, Geoffrey count of Gâtinais, was the son of <em>another Geoffrey</em>
and Beatrice, daughter of Alberic <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> of Mâcon
    (<cite>Mabille, <abbr title="introduction">introd.</abbr>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <abbr title="85">lxxxv</abbr>–<abbr title="86">lxxxvi</abbr></cite>). It seems probable that Orléans and
Châteaulandon went together in fact as well as in Angevin legend.
Assuming therefore that Ménage was copying a document now
lost, the pedigree would stand thus:</p>

<p class="noindent">If we might assume also, with <abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Mabille, that the “Alberic”
whose signature appears beside that of Fulk the Red in 886
    <cite>(Mabille, <abbr title="introduction">introd.</abbr> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <abbr title="49">lix</abbr>, note 1</cite>) was the father of the first
Geoffrey of Orléans, then the two names would stand alternate till
we come to Hermengard’s husband. Is it just possible that (on a
principle somewhat like that which made all the dukes of Aquitaine
assume the name of William) this alternation of names grew into a
family tradition, so that the son of Geoffrey <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> and Beatrice having
by some accident been christened by his father’s instead of his
grandfather’s name, assumed the latter officially on succeeding to
the title, and thus became known to outsiders as “Alberic,” while
his own son (Fulk Rechin) spoke of him by his original and real
name?</p>

<p>However this may be, he was most probably descended from the
family who became viscounts of Orléans at about the same time that
the house of Anjou was being founded. They make no figure in
history, and the Angevin writers do their best to efface them altogether.
Ralf de Diceto just names the father of the two young
counts, and that is all; in the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta <abbr title="Consulum">Cons.</abbr></i></cite>
his very name is dropped,
and the reader is left in utter darkness as to who and what Martel’s
nephews were. They were Martel’s nephews, and that was all that
anybody was intended to know about them. Fulk Rechin himself,
or his representative, merges the Châteaulandon connexion almost
completely in the Angevin, and regards himself simply as the grandson
of Fulk Nerra. After all, they are right; it was Fulk Nerra’s
blood that made his grandsons what they were; their father might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251">251</a></span>
have been anybody, or, as he almost appears, nobody, for all the
influence he had on their characters or their destinies.</p>

<span class="note_title">THE HEIR OF GEOFFREY MARTEL.</span></h4>

<p>Of the disposal of his territories made by Geoffrey Martel there
are three versions.</p>

<p>1. The
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta <abbr title="Consulum">Cons.</abbr></i> (Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 131)</cite>,
    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Ralf de Diceto">R. Diceto</abbr> (<i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i>
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 333; Stubbs, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 185)</cite>
and
    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicon Turonense Magnum">Chron. Tur. Magn.</abbr> (Salmon,
<i><abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Chroniques de Touraine">Chron. Touraine</abbr></i>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 122, 123)</cite>
say that Anjou and Saintonge were
left to Fulk, Touraine and Gâtinais to Geoffrey.</p>

<p>2. A <abbr title="Manuscript">MS.</abbr> representing the earliest form of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta <abbr title="Consulum">Cons.</abbr></i>
(ending in 1106) says just the opposite: Anjou and Saintonge to
Geoffrey, Touraine and Gâtinais to Fulk
    (<cite>Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 131,
note 1</cite>.
See
    <cite>Mabille, <abbr title="introduction">introd.</abbr> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> iv–viii)</cite>.</p>

<p>3.
    <cite>Orderic (Duchesne, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Historiae Normannorum Scriptores">Hist. Norm. Scriptt.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 532)</cite>
and
    <cite><abbr title="William of Poitiers">Will.
Poitiers</abbr> (<i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 188, 189)</cite>
ignore Fulk and make Geoffrey sole heir.</p>

<p>The first version is easily disposed of. In three charters of
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Florence of Saumur, one of 1061
    (<cite>Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Archives d’Anjou</i>,
<abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 259</cite>) and two whose dates must be between 1062 and
1066
    (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 278)</cite>,
and in one of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Maur, 1066
    (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 358–360)</cite>,
Geoffrey the Bearded is formally described as count of Anjou.
The strongest proof of all is a charter of Fulk Rechin himself,
March 11, 1068, setting forth how Geoffrey, nephew and <i>heir</i> of
Geoffrey Martel, had made certain promises to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Florence, which
he, Fulk, having now got possession of Anjou, fulfilled
    (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 260</cite>).</p>

<p>The second version, though apparently not contradicted by any
documentary proof, has nothing to support it, and contains an
internal difficulty. For how could Martel leave the Gâtinais to
Fulk? Surely it was not his to leave at all, but would pass as a
matter of course to Geoffrey as Alberic’s (Geoffrey’s?) eldest son.
The old confusion of the relations of the Gâtinais to Anjou peeps
out again here.</p>

<p>The third account is that of foreign writers; but those writers
are Orderic and William of Poitiers. And they are not unsupported.
Geoffrey Martel’s last act, a charter granted to Marmoutier on his
deathbed, is signed by his <i>nephew and successor-designate Geoffrey</i>,
and by Fulk, who is described simply as the latter’s brother
    (<cite>Mabille,
<abbr title="introduction">introd.</abbr> <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> <abbr title="84">lxxxiv</abbr></cite>).</p>

<p>The conclusion to which all this leads is that Martel bequeathed
the whole of his dominions to his elder nephew Geoffrey, and that
all the conflicting stories of a division of territory were inventions to
save the character of Fulk Rechin. It is possible that Martel did,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252">252</a></span>
as Fulk says, invest him with Saintonge, but even here it is evident
that the elder brother’s rights were reserved, for it is Geoffrey, not
Fulk, who fights for Saintonge with the duke of Aquitaine.</p>

<p>One portion of Martel’s dominions is named in none of these
accounts, except Fulk’s; and that is Maine. Fulk coolly puts it
into the list of his own possessions, and <abbr lang="fr" xml:lang="fr" title="Monsieur">M.</abbr> Mabille regards this as
a blunder proving that the author of the
    <cite><i>Fragment</i></cite>
was not what he
professes to be. May it not rather tell the other way? A forger
would have remembered that Maine was lost and not risked such a
glaring falsehood; the count ignores its <i>de facto</i> loss because he
holds himself its overlord <i>de jure</i>. We shall find Geoffrey the
Bearded making his appearance as titular overlord of Maine in
1063. Did Martel feel about Maine as William the Conqueror
seems to have felt about England?</p>

<span class="note_title">THE WAR OF SAINTONGE.</span></h4>

<p>The account of this war between Geoffrey the Bearded and
Guy-Geoffrey, <i>alias</i> William <abbr title="7">VII.</abbr>, of Aquitaine, has to be made out
from one direct source and one indirect one. The first is the
    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicon Sancti Maxentii">Chron. S. Maxent.</abbr> <abbr title="year">a.</abbr> 1061 (Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglises</i>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 402, 403)</cite>:
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Goffredus et Fulco habentes certamen cum Gaufredo duce propter
Sanctonas, venientes cum magno exercitu, pugnaverunt cum eo in
bello etiam in Aquitaniâ, ubi e contrario Pictavorum exercitus
adunatus est; et ab utrisque partibus magnis animositatibus
pugnatum est, sed traditores belli et ceteri signiferi, vexillis projectis,
exercitum Pictavensium in fugam verterunt. Quapropter vulnerati
multi sunt et plurimi occisi atque nonnulli capti; unde quidam
versibus eam confusionem ita describit, dicens: Cum de Pictavis
bellum sit et Andegavinis, Inque die Martis fuit et Sancti Benedicti,
Circa forte Caput Wultonnæ contigit esse, Annus millenus tunc
sexagesimus unus.</span>”</p>

<p>That entry comprises all the direct information on the subject.
The Angevin monastic chronicles and Fulk Rechin do not mention
it at all. Neither do the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta <abbr title="Consulum">Cons.</abbr></i> in the right place; but they
mix it up with the war between Geoffrey Martel and William the
Fat in 1033. By the light of the <abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicon Sancti Maxentii">Chron. S. Maxent.</abbr>, it seems
possible to disentangle the two stories. It even seems possible to
make sense of a passage in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta</i> which never can be sense as it
stands, by understanding it as referring to Geoffrey the Bearded
instead of his uncle: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253">253</a></span>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Willelmus Pictavensium comes consulatum
Sanctonicum suum esse volebat et vi preoccupatum tenebat, quia
patrui sui fuerat. Martellus eumdem consulatum reclamabat quia avi
sui fuerat, cujus heredes absque liberis mortui erant; et ideo ad
heredes sororis avi sui debere reverti affirmabat</span>”
    (<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta <abbr title="Consulum">Cons.</abbr></i>, Marchegay,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 126</cite>). This is the story by which the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta</i>-writer
professes to explain the cause of the war of Geoffrey Martel
and William the Fat, of which he then gives an elaborate account,
ending with William’s capture and the consequent surrender of
Saintes to Geoffrey. But the story is utterly senseless; the claims
of William and Martel as therein stated are alike devoid of all show
of reason. In the account of the war itself, too, there are strong
traces of confusion; Saintes is assumed to have passed back into
the duke’s hands, of which there is no sign elsewhere; and to crown
all, the scene of the battle in which William is taken is laid, not as
by the
    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicon Sancti Maxentii">Chron. S. Maxent.</abbr> (a. 1032, Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglises</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 392)</cite>
and
    <cite>Fulk Rechin (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 378)</cite>,
at <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Jouin-de-Marne or Montcontour,
but at Chef-Boutonne. The question then arises: Can this wild
tale in the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta</i>, which is quite impossible as an explanation of
Martel’s war with William <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr>, be interpreted so as to explain his
successor’s war with William <abbr title="7">VII.</abbr>?</p>

<p>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Willelmus <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">[<abbr title="7">VII.</abbr>, <i>alias</i> Guy-Geoffrey]</span> Pictavensium comes consulatum
Sanctonicum suum esse volebat et vi præoccupatum tenebat
<span lang="en" xml:lang="en">[having presumably seized it on Martel’s death]</span>, quia patrui sui <span lang="en" xml:lang="en">[for
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patrui</i> read <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">fratris</i>—William the Fat—or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">patris</i>, William the Great]</span>
fuerat. Martellus [Barbatus] eumdem consulatum reclamabat, quia
avi sui [Fulconis Nerræ] fuerat, cujus hæredes [<i>i.e.</i> G. Martellus]
absque liberis mortui essent; et ideo ad hæredes sororis avi sui
<span lang="en" xml:lang="en">[read <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">avunculi sui</i>—Martel’s sister, the Bearded one’s mother]</span> debere
reverti affirmabat.</span>”</p>

<p>Read in this way, the story is quite reasonable and intelligible,
and the rest of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta’s</i> account might stand almost intact, except
the capture of the duke, which of course is dragged in from the
earlier war. The confusion between the Williams of Aquitaine is
easily accounted for, and so is that between the Geoffreys of Anjou,
especially as all the Geoffreys after Martel occasionally took to themselves
his cognomen.</p>

<span class="note_title">THE DESCENDANTS OF HERBERT WAKE-DOG.</span></h4>

<p>Not the least puzzling matter connected with the Cenomannian
wars is the genealogy of the sovereign house of Maine. The
succession of the counts themselves—Hugh <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> (or David), Herbert <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>
(Wake-dog), Hugh <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, Herbert <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>—is plain enough, as also that
each was the son of his predecessor. But the filiation of the women<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254">254</a></span>
of the family—Margaret, Gersendis, Paula and Biota—is far from
being equally clear.</p>

<p>1. As to Margaret, there is no real doubt. Orderic does once
    (<cite>Duchesne, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Historiae Normannorum Scriptores">Hist. Norm. Scriptt.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 683</cite>) call her a daughter of
Herbert [<abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>]; but his own statements in two other places
    (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr>
487 and 532</cite>), as well as
    <cite><abbr title="William of Poitiers">Will. Poitiers</abbr> (<i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 190)</cite>,
shew that this is
a mere slip. Margaret was clearly a daughter of Hugh <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> and sister
of Herbert <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr></p>

<p>2. As to Biota. Orderic
    (<cite>as above, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 487</cite>) calls her “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hugonis
Cenomannensium comitis filiam</span>”; in <abbr title="William of Poitiers">Will. Poitiers</abbr> (<i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 189) she is
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><em>soror</em> Hugonis</span>”; and Mr. Freeman (<i><abbr title="Norman Conquest">Norm. Conq.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="third edition">3d ed.</abbr>, <abbr title="volume 3">vol. iii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr>
200, and note T, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 676) adopts the latter version. Biota, then, was
a daughter of Herbert Wake-dog and sister of Hugh <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> But were
Gersendis and Paula her sisters or her nieces?</p>

<p>3. The fullest and most distinct statement of the Cenomannian
pedigree is that of Orderic in
    <cite>Duchesne, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Historiae Normannorum Scriptores">Hist. Norm. Scriptt.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 532</cite>:
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hugo filius Herberti <span class="dots">...</span> Bertam <span class="dots">...</span> in conjugium accepit;
quæ filium nomine Herbertum et tres filias ei peperit. Una earum
data est Azsoni Marchiso Liguriæ. Alia nomine Margarita Rodberto
filio Guillelmi Ducis Neustriæ desponsata est <span class="dots">...</span> Tertia vero
Joanni domino castri quod Flecchia dicitur nupsit.</span>”</p>

<p>With regard to this last marriage, it is to be observed that in the
speech which Orderic puts into the mouth of Elias of La Flèche,
addressing Hugh of Este
    (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 684</cite>), he says nothing about his
mother at all, but makes him trace his descent from Herbert Wake-dog
through his grandmother, whom he calls Herbert’s daughter:
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Filia Herberti comitis Lancelino de Balgenceio nupsit, eique <span class="dots">...</span>
Joannem meum genitorem peperit.</span>” The name of John’s wife,
Paula, comes from another passage of Orderic
    (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 768</cite>); but he
there says nothing about her parentage, merely calling her son Elias
“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hugonis Cenomannorum consulis consobrinus.</span>” The houses of
Le Mans and La Flèche cannot have intermarried twice in two succeeding
generations; one of Orderic’s statements must be wrong;
but which, I cannot decide.</p>

<p>The last point is the parentage of Gersendis, the wife of Azzo of
Este; and as the whole tone of Elias’s speech (as above) implies that
he and her son were related to the counts of Le Mans in the same
degree, the solution of this question might almost be held to decide
the previous one also. This seems to be Mr. Freeman’s opinion,
and he regards Orderic’s statement quoted above as conclusive that
Gersendis and Paula were both daughters of Hugh <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, and sisters
therefore of Margaret and Herbert <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, in spite of the biographer of
the bishops of Le Mans
    (<cite>Mabillon, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Vetera Analecta">Vet. Anal.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 308</cite>), who expressly
says that Gersendis was a daughter of Herbert Wake-dog,
and the continuator of <abbr title="William of Jumièges">Will. Jumièges</abbr>, who says<span class="nobreak">:—</span><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255">255</a></span>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cenomannenses
<span class="dots">...</span> consilium ineunt cum Heliâ filio Joannis de Flecâ <span class="dots">...</span> ut
<em>filiam cujusdam comitis Langobardiæ, neptem videlicet Hereberti quondam
Cenomannensis comitis ex primogenitâ filiâ</em>, in matrimonium
ducat.</span>”
    <cite><abbr title="William of Jumièges">Will. Jumièges</abbr>, <abbr title="book 8">l. viii.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 5 (Duchesne, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Historiae Normannorum Scriptores">Hist. Norm.
Scriptt.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 294)</cite>.
This re-appears in
    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Ralf de Diceto">R. Diceto</abbr> (Stubbs, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr>
183, 184; Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 334)</cite>
in the following form<span class="nobreak">:—</span>“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Helias,
filius Johannis de Flecâ, Sibillam, filiam cujusdam comitis
Longobardiæ, neptem scilicet Hereberti quondam Cenomannorum
comitis, duxit uxorem, et cum eâ comitatum Cenomanniæ suscepit.</span>”
But this is certainly wrong; for the first wife of Elias was Matilda
of Château-du-Loir, and the second was Agnes of Perche.</p>

<p>What Elias could have had to gain by the marriage thus proposed
for him it is impossible to guess, as he himself certainly was
quite as nearly related to the counts of Maine as this oddly-described
bride could have been. Mr. Freeman
    (<cite><i><abbr title="Norman Conquest">Norm. Conq.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="third edition">3d ed.</abbr>, <abbr title="volume 3">vol. iii.</abbr>,
note T, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 676</cite>), takes the description as favouring Orderic’s theory,
and remarks: “The words could only have been written by one who
looked on Gersendis as a sister of Herbert.” “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Neptem Hereberti</span>,”
then, he interprets, “niece of Herbert [II].” But is it not a much
simpler interpretation of the whole phrase—“<em lang="la" xml:lang="la">neptem Hereberti ex
primogenitâ filiâ</em>”—to read it “granddaughter of Herbert [I.] through
his eldest daughter”? In that case, we should have another witness
on the side of the bishops’ biographer.</p>

<p>There is another curious bit of evidence which at first glance
seems also to tell in his favour. I do not think that it really proves
anything about the matter; but it is worth examining for other
reasons. <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr> d’Arbois de Jubainville
    (<cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes de Champagne</i>, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr>
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 392, note 5</cite>), declares it proved on documentary evidence that
Stephen-Henry of Blois, the father of our King Stephen, was the
son of Theobald <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> by his first marriage with Gersendis of Maine.
About the marriage itself there is no doubt, nor about the divorce
which followed it; and the latter had taken place in 1049 at latest,
for Theobald was excommunicated for that very cause by the
Council of Reims. Most historians seem however to have supposed
that Gersendis was then a mere child, and that the mother of
Stephen, as well as of Theobald’s other children, was his second wife,
Adela of Valois. <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr> de Jubainville, in support of his opinion,
refers especially to two charters. One is in
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gallia Christiana</i>, <abbr title="volume 8">vol.
viii.</abbr>, <abbr title="instruments">instr.</abbr> <abbr title="column">col.</abbr> 548</cite>.
It has no date, and says nothing about
Stephen’s mother or his stepmother; I therefore cannot see its
bearing on the question. The other is in
    <cite>Bernier, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de
Blois, preuves</i>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <abbr title="13">xiii</abbr>–<abbr title="14">xiv</abbr></cite>.
In it Stephen-Henry, in the year
1089, grants certain lands to Pontlevoy “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro animæ meæ et uxoris
et Theobaldi patris mei et <em>matris meæ Gandree</em> <span class="dots">...</span> remedio</span>”; and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256">256</a></span>has the grant confirmed “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">nomine <span class="dots">...</span> Alæ uxoris meæ, <em>Alæ uxoris
Thebaudi comitis</em></span>,” etc. This certainly seems to shew that Adela was
not his mother, though it does not necessarily follow that “Gandree”
represents Gersendis. If it does, Stephen-Henry must have been
born in 1049 at latest, and therefore Gersendis cannot possibly have
been a daughter of Hugh <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, who was not married till 1040 at the
very earliest.</p>

<p>The greatest puzzle in the whole matter, however, is this: If
Stephen-Henry was really the eldest son of Gersendis of Maine, how
does it happen that neither in 1073, nor in 1089, nor in any of the
Cenomannian revolutions and wars, do we hear a single word about
his claims upon the county? <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr> d’Arbois de Jubainville’s suggestion
in fact opens a question much more important and much more
obscure than that of the age and parentage of Gersendis. He
certainly seems to have proved that Adela of Valois was not Stephen’s
mother; but has he proved that Gersendis was? The only bit of
evidence, direct or indirect, which it seems possible to bring to bear
upon this matter is a passage in the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Historia Pontificalis</i> (Pertz,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Monumenta Germaniae Historica">Mon. Germ. Hist.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 20">vol. xx.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 531)</cite>
where it is said that the cause
of our King Stephen was upheld by some of the Roman cardinals
who claimed kindred with him “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">eo quod avia ejus Lumbarda fuerit</span>.”
Now, as the second husband of Gersendis was a Lombard, this may
come from some confused idea about her. But it also suggests
another possible solution of the whole question about Stephen-Henry’s
mother. Theobald and Gersendis were divorced in 1049
at latest; the first record in which Adela appears as Theobald’s
wife is dated 1061
    (<cite>Jubainville, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes de Champagne</i>, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr>
393, note 3</cite>). May not the mysterious “Gandrea” of the charter
of 1089 have been an Italian lady who was married to Theobald,
became the mother of his heir, and died, between those two dates?</p>

<h4 class="note" id="note_4e"><span class="smcap">Note E.</span><br />

<span class="note_title">THE SIEGE OF LA FLÈCHE AND TREATY OF BLANCHELANDE.</span></h4>

<p>There are two questionable points connected with these matters:
1. the date; 2. the geography.</p>

<p>1. The only original writer who gives a detailed account of both
siege and treaty is Orderic, who carries his story straight on from
the quelling of the revolt of Maine in 1073 to the siege of La
Flèche, as if it had all happened in the same year, before William
returned to England with his troops. On the other hand, none of
the Angevin writers mention La Flèche under date 1073; but the
    <cite><abbr title="Chronicles of">Chronn.</abbr> <abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Sancti Albini">S. Albin.</abbr> and <abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Sancti Florentii Salmurensis">S. Flor. Salm.</abbr> (Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglises</i>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 26,
189)</cite>
have “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Exercitus de Fissâ</span>,” the former in 1077, the latter in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257">257</a></span>
1078; and in the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Art de vérifier les Dates</i> these entries are interpreted
as referring to the siege which was followed by the treaty of
Blanchelande. <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr> Voisin (<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Cénomans</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 414) dates the whole
affair 1085; he gives no reason and seems to be quite unsupported.
The choice lies therefore between Orderic’s date and that of the
Angevin chronicles. Mr. Freeman
    (<cite><i><abbr title="Norman Conquest">Norm. Conq.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 4">vol. iv.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 560–563</cite>)
follows Orderic, and I have done the same.</p>

<p>2. As to the geography. Orderic
    (<cite>Duchesne, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Historiae Normannorum Scriptores">Hist. Norm.
Scriptt.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 533</cite>) says that to meet William the Angevin and Breton
host, leaving La Flèche, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ligerim fluvium audacter pertransierunt.</span>”
Now this must be wrong, as the Loire is a long way south of La
Flèche. It is clear that for <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ligerim</em>, “Loire,” we must read <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liderim</em>,
“Loir,” as Mr. Freeman says
    (<cite><i><abbr title="Norman Conquest">Norm. Conq.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 4">vol. iv.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 562,
note 2</cite>). Even crossing the Loir seems rather a strange proceeding;
for La Flèche being on the right or north bank of that river, they
must have crossed it to the southward—<i>i.e.</i> away from Normandy.
How came it that William, marching against them out of Normandy,
had gone so far down to the south of them?</p>

<p>There is however a further question as to the actual place of the
treaty, which Mr. Freeman
    (<cite>as above, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 562</cite>) places at Bruère in
the Passais. If such was the case, Orderic’s story of the crossing
of the river becomes quite hopeless, as Bruère is a long way north-west
of La Flèche. But there is another version. J. Pesche in
his
    <cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dictionnaire historique de la Sarthe</i>, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 168</cite>,
under
“<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><i>Blanchelande</i> ou <i>Blanche-bruyère</i></span>,” says: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vaste espace de terrain
infertile, où croît abondamment le lichen des rennes, dont la
blancheur lui aura fait donner son nom; situé <em>entre La Flèche et Le
Lude</em>, côtoyé par la route qui conduit de l’une à l’autre de ces deux
villes.</span>” It is this which Pesche and, following him, <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr> Voisin
(<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Cénomans</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 414, note 1) mark as the scene of the treaty.
So does <abbr title="Monsieur" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.</abbr> Prévost in a note to Orderic, <abbr title="volume 2">vol. ii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 258, and he
adds that a farm there still in 1840 bore the name of Blanchelande.
If this theory is correct, Orderic’s geography is quite right and
clear; the besiegers of La Flèche, on the north side of the Loir,
crossing over to its southern bank, would march straight upon the
“white moor.” William must then have crossed higher up and
made a circuit to the south-east of them. The only question
remaining would be, what was his reason for this movement? To
which there was doubtless a good military answer.</p>

<p>With regard to the second siege of La Flèche by Fulk Rechin,
in 1081, there is a very strange story in the
    <cite><abbr title="Chronica Rainaldus Andegavensis">Chron. Rain. Andeg.</abbr>
(Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglises</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 13)</cite>.
We are there told that Fulk not
only took and burned the castle (as the
    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicæ Sancti Albini">Chron. S. Albin.</abbr>, <i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 26</cite>,
also states under the same year) in revenge, for John’s rebellion
against him, but also punished King William for his previous relief<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258">258</a></span>
of the castle, by so worsting him in battle that he retreated after
giving hostages for peace, among whom were his brother the count
of Mortain and his own son! Mr. Freeman says nothing of this
very apocryphal-looking story. Is it anything more than an Angevin
travesty of Robert’s homage to Fulk at Blanchelande?</p>

<span class="note_title">THE MARRIAGE OF GEOFFREY AND MATILDA.</span></h4>

<p>The date of this marriage is commonly given as 1127. A comparison
of evidence seems however to lead to the conclusion that its
true date is 1128.</p>

<p>1.
    <cite>The Angevin chronicles</cite>
never mention the marriage at all.
The
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta <abbr title="Consulum">Cons.</abbr></i></cite>,
    <cite><abbr title="William of Jumièges">Will. Jumièges</abbr></cite>
and several other writers mention
it without any kind of date.
    <cite>The English Chronicle</cite>,
    <cite><abbr title="Simeon of Durham">Sim. Durh.</abbr></cite>,
    <cite><abbr title="William of Malmesbury">Will. Malm.</abbr></cite>
and
    <cite><abbr title="Henry of Huntingdon">Hen. Hunt.</abbr></cite>
give no distinct date, but imply that
the proposal was immediately followed by the wedding. They speak
as if Robert and Brian had taken Matilda over sea and married her
to Geoffrey without more ado.</p>

<p>2. Orderic mentions the marriage in two places. In the first
    (<cite>Duchesne, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Historiae Normannorum Scriptores">Hist. Norm. Scriptt.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 763</cite>) he gives no clue to the
date; in the second
    (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 889</cite>) he dates it 1129.</p>

<p>3. The
    <cite><span lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Chronicon">Chron.</abbr> Fiscannense</span> (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Rerum Gallicarum Scriptores">Rer. Gall. Scriptt.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 12">vol. xii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 778)</cite>
dates it 1127.</p>

<p>4. A charter of agreement between the bishop of Séez and the
convent of Marmoutier (printed in
    <cite>Gilles Bry’s <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr"><abbr title="Histoire">Hist.</abbr> de Perche</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr>
106</cite>) has “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">signum Henrici Regis quando dedit filiam suam Gaufredo
comiti Andegavensi juniori</span>.” It is dated “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">anno ab Inc. Dom.
1127, Indictione <abbr title="6">VI.</abbr></span>”</p>

<p>5. The last witness is John of Marmoutier, the author of the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Historia Gaufredi Ducis</i></cite>.
From him we might have expected a
distinct and authentic statement; but he does not mention the year
at all. He says that Geoffrey was knighted on Whit-Sunday and
married on its octave, and that he was then fifteen years of age
    (<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Historia Gaufredi Ducis">Hist. Gaufr. Ducis</abbr></i>, Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 236, 233</cite>). Afterwards,
in speaking of the birth of Henry Fitz-Empress, he says
that it took place in the fourth year of his parents’ marriage
    (<cite><i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i>
<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 277, 278</cite>). Henry was born on Mid-Lent Sunday, March 5,
1133; if therefore the writer reckoned backwards from the
Whitsuntide of that year, his words ought to mean that the
marriage was in 1129. But as he goes on to state that Matilda’s
third son was born in the sixth year of her marriage, and that Henry
<abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> died “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">anno eodem, ab Incarnatione videlicet Domini 1137</span>,” it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259">259</a></span>
impossible to say what he did mean. Whether he is collecting the
traditions of the ancient counts or writing the life of his own contemporary
sovereign, John’s chronology is pursued by the same fate;
whenever he mentions a date by the year, he is almost certain to
make it wrong. But that he should have done the like in his
reckoning of days, or even of his hero’s age, by no means follows.
To consider the latter point first: Geoffrey the Handsome was born
on August 24, 1113
    (<cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicæ Sancti Albini">Chron. S. Albin.</abbr> <i>ad <abbr title="annum">ann.</abbr></i>, Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Eglises</i>,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 32</cite>). Therefore, if John meant that he was past fifteen at his
marriage, it must have been in 1129. But if he only meant “in
his fifteenth year,” it would be 1128. In that year the octave of
Pentecost fell on June 17; Geoffrey then lacked but two months to
the completion of his fifteenth year; and considering Matilda’s age,
it is no wonder that the panegyrist tried to make her husband out
as old as possible. It is in fact plain that such was his intention,
for though he places Geoffrey’s death in the right year, 1151, he
gives his age as forty-one instead of thirty-eight (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Historia Gaufredi Ducis">Hist. Gaufr. Ducis</abbr></i>,
Marchegay, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtes</i>, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 292).</p>

<p>The most important matter, however, is John’s statement that
the wedding took place on the octave of Pentecost. The date in
this case is not one casually slipped in by the writer in passing; it
comes in a detailed account of the festivities at Rouen on the occasion
of Geoffrey’s knighting, which is expressly said to have occurred
at Pentecost, and to have been followed by his marriage on the
octave. Now this leaves us on the horns of a dilemma fatal alike
to the date in the
    <cite><abbr lang="la" xml:lang="la" title="Chronicon Fiscannense">Chron. Fiscann.</abbr></cite>,
1127, and to that of Orderic,
1129. For, on the one hand, <abbr title="William of Malmesbury">Will. Malm.</abbr>
    (<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Historia Novella">Hist. Nov.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="book 1">l. i.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 3,
Hardy, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 692</cite>) says that Matilda did not go to Normandy till <em>after</em>
Whitsuntide [1127]; and
    <cite><abbr title="Henry of Huntingdon">Hen. Hunt.</abbr>, <abbr title="book 7">l. vii.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 37 (Arnold, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 247)</cite>,
adds that the king followed her in August
    <cite>(<abbr title="Simeon of Durham">Sim. Durh.</abbr>, <abbr title="edited by">ed.</abbr> Arnold,
<abbr title="volume 2">vol. ii.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 281, 282</cite>,
really witnesses to the same effect; for his
chronology of the whole story is a year in advance). Consequently,
as Mrs. Everett Green remarks, “the union could not have taken
place before the spring of the following year, 1128”
    (<cite><i>Princesses of
England</i>, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 107, 108</cite>). On the other hand, it is plain that
Fulk was present at his son’s wedding; but before Whitsuntide 1129
Fulk was himself married to the princess of Jerusalem
    (<cite><abbr title="William of Tyre">Will. Tyr.</abbr>,
<abbr title="book 13">l. xiii.</abbr> <abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 24</cite>).</p>

<p>From all this it results: 1. If Geoffrey and Matilda were married
in 1127, it cannot have been earlier than September, <i>i.e.</i> at least
three months after Whitsuntide. 2. If they were married in 1129,
it must have been quite at the beginning of the year, and Orderic
must, on this occasion at least, have made his year begin in English
fashion, at Christmas. 3. If they were married at Whitsuntide, it
can only have been in 1128.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260">260</a></span></p>

<p>We have in short to choose one out of three authorities: the
Chronicle of Fécamp, Orderic and John of Marmoutier—for the
Séez charter, as Mrs. Everett Green remarks
    (<cite><i>Princesses</i>, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr>
108</cite>), proves nothing more than that the betrothal had taken place
in 1127. Of these three, the first is certainly of least account.
Orderic, on the other hand, is on most other subjects a far better
authority than John. But his chronology is very little better than
John’s, at any rate towards the close of his work; his whole account
of Henry’s later years is sketchy and confused; while John is
Geoffrey Plantagenet’s own special biographer, writing within sixty
years of the event, from materials furnished by personal followers of
his hero. I cannot but regard him as our primary authority on this
subject, and believe on his testimony that the real wedding-day of
Geoffrey and Matilda was the octave of Pentecost, June 17, 1128.</p>

<span class="ch2">GEOFFREY PLANTAGENET AND STEPHEN OF BLOIS.</span><br />

<span class="ch3">1128–1139.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">All</span> the mental and bodily gifts wherewith nature had
endowed the most favoured members of the Angevin house
seemed to have been showered upon the eldest son of Fulk
<abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr> and Aremburg of Maine. The surname by which he is
most generally known, and which an inveterate usage has
attached to his descendants as well as to himself, is in
its origin and meaning curiously unlike most historical
surnames; it seems to have been derived simply from his
boyish habit of adorning his cap with a sprig of “planta-genista,”
the broom which in early summer makes the
open country of Anjou and Maine a blaze of living gold.
With a fair and ruddy countenance, lit up by the lightning-glance
of a pair of brilliant eyes; a tall, slender, sinewy
frame, made for grace no less than for strength and
activity<span class="nobreak">:—</span><a id="Anchor_628" href="#Footnote_628" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 628.">[628]</a> in the unanimous opinion of his contemporaries,
he was emphatically “Geoffrey the Handsome.” To
this prepossessing appearance were added the charms of
a gracious manner and a ready, pleasant speech;<a id="Anchor_629" href="#Footnote_629" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 629.">[629]</a> and
beneath this winning exterior there lay a considerable share
of the quick wits of his race, sharpened and developed
by such a careful education as was given to very few
princes of the time. The intellectual soil was worthy of
the pains bestowed upon it, and brought forth a harvest of,
perhaps, somewhat too precocious scholarship and sagacity.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262">262</a></span>
Geoffrey’s fondness for the study of the past seems to have
been an inheritance from Fulk Rechin; the historian-count
might have been proud of a grandson who carried in his
memory all the battles fought, all the great deeds done, not
only by his own people but also in foreign lands.<a id="Anchor_630" href="#Footnote_630" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 630.">[630]</a> Even
Fulk the Good might have approved a descendant who when
still a mere boy could shine in serious conversation with such
a “lettered king” as Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>;<a id="Anchor_631" href="#Footnote_631" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 631.">[631]</a> and Fulk the Black might
not have been ashamed of one who in early youth felt the
“demon-blood” within him too hot to rest content in luxury
and idleness, avoided the corrupting influences of mere
revelry, gave himself up to the active exercises of military
life,<a id="Anchor_632" href="#Footnote_632" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 632.">[632]</a> and, while so devoted to letters that he would not even
go to war without a learned teacher by his side,<a id="Anchor_633" href="#Footnote_633" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 633.">[633]</a> turned his
book-learning to account in ways at which ruder warriors and
more unworldly scholars were evidently somewhat astonished.<a id="Anchor_634" href="#Footnote_634" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 634.">[634]</a>
Like his ancestor the Black Count, Geoffrey was one of those
men about whom their intimate associates have a fund of
anecdotes to tell. The “History” of his life put together
from their information, a few years after his death, is chiefly
made up of these stories; and through the mass of trite
moralizing and pedantic verbiage in which the compiler has
imbedded them there still peeps out unmistakeably the
peculiar temper of his hero. Geoffrey’s readiness to forgive
those who threw themselves upon his mercy is a favourite
theme of his biographer’s praise; but the instances given of
this clemency indicate more of the vanity and display of
chivalry in its narrower sense than of real tenderness of
heart or generosity of soul. Such is the story of a discontented
knight whose ill-will against his sovereign took the
grotesque form of a wish that he had the neck of “that red-head
Geoffrey” fast between the two hot iron plates used for
making a wafer-cake called <i>oublie</i>. It chanced that the man
whose making of <i>oublies</i>—then, as now, a separate trade—had
suggested the wish of this knight at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>-Aignan shortly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263">263</a></span>
afterwards made some for the eating and in the presence of
Count Geoffrey himself, to whom he related what he had
heard. The knight and his comrades were presently caught
harrying the count’s lands; and the biographer is lost in admiration
at Geoffrey’s generosity in forgiving not only their
depredations, but the more heinous crime of having, in a fit
of ill-temper after dinner, expressed a desire to make a wafer
of him.<a id="Anchor_635" href="#Footnote_635" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 635.">[635]</a> On another occasion we find the count’s wrath
averted by the charms of music and verse, enhanced no
doubt by the further charm of a little flattery. Four Poitevin
knights who had been taken captive in one of the skirmishes
so common on the Aquitanian border won their release by
the truly southern expedient of singing in Geoffrey’s hearing
a rime which they had composed in his praise.<a id="Anchor_636" href="#Footnote_636" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 636.">[636]</a> A touch of
truer poetry comes out in another story. Geoffrey, with a
great train of attendants and noble guests, was once keeping
Christmas at Le Mans. From his private chapel, where he
had been attending the nocturnal services of the vigil, he set
out at daybreak at the head of a procession to celebrate in
the cathedral church the holy mysteries of the festival. At
the cathedral door he met a poorly-dressed young clerk, whom
he flippantly saluted: “Any news, sir clerkling?”—“Ay,
my lord, the best of good news!”—“What?” cried Geoffrey,
all his curiosity aroused—“tell me quick!”—“‘Unto us a
Child is born, unto us a Son is given!’” Abashed, Geoffrey
asked the youth his name, bade him join the other clergy in
the choir, and as soon as mass was over went straight to the
bishop: “For the love of Him Who was born this day, give
me a prebend in your church.” It was no sooner granted
than taking his new acquaintance by the hand, he begged
leave to make him his substitute, and added the further gift
of a stall in his own chapel, as a token of gratitude to the
poor clerk whose answer to his thoughtless question had
brought home to him, perhaps more deeply than he had ever
felt them before, the glad tidings of Christmas morning.<a id="Anchor_637" href="#Footnote_637" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 637.">[637]</a>
From another of these anecdotes Geoffrey seems, as far as
we can make out, to have been the original hero of an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264">264</a></span>
adventure which has since, in slightly varying forms, been
attributed to several other princes, from Charles the Great
down to James the Fifth of Scotland, and which indeed may
easily have happened more than once. Led away by his
ardour in pursuit of the chase—next to literature, his
favourite recreation—the count one day outstripped all his
followers, and lost his way alone in the forest of Loches.
At last he fell in with a charcoal-burner, who undertook to
conduct him back to the castle. Geoffrey mounted his
guide behind him; and as they rode along, the peasant,
ignorant of his companion’s rank, and taking him for a
simple knight, let himself be drawn into conversation on
sundry matters, including a free criticism on the government
of the reigning count, and the oppressions suffered by the
people at the hands of his household officers. When they
reached the gates of Loches, the burst of joy which greeted
the wanderer’s return revealed to the poor man that he had
been talking to the count himself. Overwhelmed with dismay,
he tried to slip off the horse’s back; but Geoffrey held
him fast, gave him the place of honour at the evening
banquet, sent him home next day with a grant of freedom
and a liberal gift of money, and profited by the information
acquired from him to institute a thorough reform in the administration
of his own household.<a id="Anchor_638" href="#Footnote_638" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 638.">[638]</a></p>

<p>Such stories as these, while they help us to form some
picture of the manner of man that Geoffrey was, set him
before us in the romantic light in which he appears to the
best advantage. When one turns from them to a survey of
his life as a whole, one is struck with a sense of something
wanting in him. The deficiency was in truth a very serious
one; it was a lack of steady principle and of genuine feeling.
The imaginative and impulsive vein which ran through
all the more refined characters of his race lay in him very
near the surface, but it did not go very deep. His imagination
was sensitive, but his heart was cold; his impulses
sprang from the play of a quick fancy, not from the passion
of an ardent soul. One more story may furnish a slight,
but significant, illustration of his temper. For some wrong<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265">265</a></span>
done to the see of Tours Geoffrey was once threatened by
the archbishop with excommunication. Either the earlier
or the later Fulk of Jerusalem would have almost certainly
begun by a reckless defiance of the threat, and the later one,
at least, would almost as surely have ended by hearty
penance. Geoffrey began and ended with a jest: “Your
threats are vain, most reverend father; you know that the
archbishop of Tours has no jurisdiction over the patrimony
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin, and that I am one of his canons!”<a id="Anchor_639" href="#Footnote_639" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 639.">[639]</a> In all
the sterling qualities of a ruler and a man, the hasty, restless,
downright Fulk <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr> was as superior to his clever charming
son as Fulk the Black was superior to Geoffrey Martel.
But it is only fair to bear in mind that Geoffrey Plantagenet’s
life was to a great extent spoilt by his marriage.
The yoke which bound together a lad of fifteen and a
woman of twenty-five—especially such a woman as the
Empress Matilda—could not fail to press heavily on both
parties; but the one most seriously injured by it was probably
the young husband. Even in a political point of view,
to him personally his marriage was more of a hindrance
than an advantage; it cut him off from all chance of striking
out an independent career. The man himself was in
fact sacrificed to his posterity. Chained down while his
character was yet undeveloped to the irksome position of a
mere appendage to King Henry’s heiress;—plunged suddenly,
and for life, into a sphere of interests and duties alien
from his own natural temper and inclinations<span class="nobreak">:—</span>weak, selfish,
unprincipled as Geoffrey too plainly shewed himself to
be, still it was well not only for him but for others that he
had enough of the dogged Angevin thoroughness to carry
him safely and successfully, if not always gloriously, through
his somewhat dreary task till he could make it over to the
freer, as well as stronger, hands of his son.</p>

<p>The hope which inspired both the king of England and
the count of Anjou when they planned their children’s marriage
can only have been the hope of a grandson in whom
the blood of both would be united, who would gather into
his own person all conflicting claims, and in whom all feuds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266">266</a></span>
would have an end. On this depended all King Henry’s
schemes for the future; on this were concentrated all his
desires, on this were founded all his plans and arrangements
during the last seven years of his reign. In the internal
history of England those years are an almost complete
blank; they are in fact simply seven more years of the
administration of Bishop Roger of Salisbury, for Henry
himself spent almost the whole of them upon the continent.
His work was finished, and all that remained to do was to
maintain the order of things which he had established so as
to hand it on in full working to his successor. He must,
however, have begun to doubt the success of his schemes
when Geoffrey and Matilda separated little more than
twelve months after their marriage. At first, everything
had seemed to be turning in favour of Henry’s arrangements.
Six weeks after the wedding, the death of William
the Clito, wounded in a skirmish with a rival claimant of
the county of Flanders,<a id="Anchor_640" href="#Footnote_640" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 640.">[640]</a> removed the only competitor whom
the king could deem likely to stand in the way of his plans
for the descent of the crown. In the spring Fulk’s departure
for Holy Land left the young couple sole masters at Angers.
All things looked tranquil and secure when Henry returned
to England in July 1129. He had, however, been there
only a few days when he learned, to his great indignation,
that his daughter had been sent away with scorn by her
husband, and had betaken herself with a few attendants to
Rouen.<a id="Anchor_641" href="#Footnote_641" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 641.">[641]</a> There she remained for nearly two years, while
Geoffrey was busy with a general revolt among his barons.
East and west and south and north had all risen at once;
the list of rebels includes the chief landowners in all parts
of the Angevin dominions, from the old eastern outpost
Amboise to Laval on the Breton border, and from Sablé on
the confines of Anjou and Maine to Montreuil-Bellay,
Thouars and Mirebeau in the Aquitanian territory of Loudun,
and the yet more remote fief of Parthenay in Poitou.<a id="Anchor_642" href="#Footnote_642" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 642.">[642]</a>
It seems as if the disaffected barons, worsted in their struggle<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267">267</a></span>
with Fulk, had only been waiting till he was out of the
country, and now, when Geoffrey by his quarrel with his
wife had deprived himself of all chance of help from his
father-in-law, they closed in upon the boy-count with one
consent, thinking to get him into their power and wring
from him any concessions they pleased. They unintentionally
did him an immense service, for by thus suddenly
throwing him upon his own resources they made a man of
him at once. No one knew better than Geoffrey Plantagenet
that he was not the first count of Anjou who had
been left to shift for himself in difficult circumstances at the
age of fifteen; and he faced the danger with a promptitude
and energy not unworthy of Fulk Nerra’s representative.
One after another he besieged the rebel leaders in their
strongholds; one after another was forced, tricked or frightened
into submission. Once, while besieging Theobald of
Blazon in the great fortress of Mirebeau, Geoffrey was blockaded
in his turn by the count of Poitou, whom the traitors
had called to their aid; even from this peril, however, his
quick wit and youthful energy extricated him in triumph;
and the revolt was finally crushed by a severe punishment
inflicted on its most powerful leader, Lisiard of Sablé.
Geoffrey ravaged the whole of Lisiard’s estates, razed his
castle of Briolet, seized that of Suze and kept it in his own
hands for the rest of its owner’s life; while to guard against
further dangers from the same quarter, by the advice of his
faithful barons he reared, for the express purpose of defence
against incursions from Sablé, a fortress to which he gave
the name of Châteauneuf, on the left bank of the Sarthe, just
below the bridge made famous by the death of Count
Robert the Brave.<a id="Anchor_643" href="#Footnote_643" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 643.">[643]</a></p>

<p>King Henry had joined his daughter in Normandy in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268">268</a></span>
the summer of 1130; in July of the next year they
returned to England together. They were soon followed by
a message from Geoffrey, who was now becoming awake to
his rights and duties as husband of King Henry’s heiress, and
having made himself thoroughly master in his own dominions
felt it time to demand the return of his wife. A great
council held at Northampton on September 8 decided that
his request should be granted;<a id="Anchor_644" href="#Footnote_644" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 644.">[644]</a> and the assembled prelates
and barons repeated their homage to Matilda as her father’s
destined successor.<a id="Anchor_645" href="#Footnote_645" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 645.">[645]</a> She then went back to her husband,
by whom she was, if not warmly welcomed, at least received
with all due courtesy and honour.<a id="Anchor_646" href="#Footnote_646" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 646.">[646]</a> Fortunately for the
ill-matched couple, they were both of that cold-blooded
temperament to which intense personal affection is not a
necessary of life. Henceforth they were content to work
together as partners in political enterprise, and to find in
community of worldly interests a sufficient bond of union.
On Mid-Lent Sunday—March 5, 1133—the
bond was made indissoluble by the birth of their son and
heir. Most fittingly, the child to whom so many diverse
nationalities looked as to their future sovereign<a id="Anchor_647" href="#Footnote_647" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 647.">[647]</a> was born
not in the actual home of either of his parents, but in that
city of Le Mans which lay midway between Normandy and
Anjou, which had so long been the ground of their strife,
and had at last been made the scene of their union.<a id="Anchor_648" href="#Footnote_648" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 648.">[648]</a> He
was baptized in the cathedral church by the bishop of the
diocese on Easter Eve, receiving the name of his grandfather
Henry, and was then, by his mother’s special desire, solemnly
placed under the protection of the local patron saint on the
same altar where his father had been dedicated in like
manner thirteen years before.<a id="Anchor_649" href="#Footnote_649" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 649.">[649]</a></p>

<p>To King Henry the birth of his grandson was the
crowning of all his hopes. The greatest difficulty which
had hitherto stood in the way of his scheme for the descent
of the crown—the objection which was sure to be made
against Matilda on account of her sex—would lose more
than half its force now that she could be regarded as regent
for her infant son; and Henry at once summoned another
great council at which he again made the archbishops,
bishops, earls and barons of his realm swear fealty to the
Empress “and also to her little son whom he appointed to
be king after him.”<a id="Anchor_650" href="#Footnote_650" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 650.">[650]</a> All things seemed as safe as human
foresight could make them when in the beginning of August
he crossed over to Normandy.<a id="Anchor_651" href="#Footnote_651" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 651.">[651]</a> Signs and wonders in
earth and sky, related afterwards as tokens of coming
evil, accompanied his voyage;<a id="Anchor_652" href="#Footnote_652" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 652.">[652]</a> but nearly two years passed
away before the portents were fulfilled. In the spring
Matilda joined her father at Rouen, and there, shortly before
Whitsuntide, her second son was born.<a id="Anchor_653" href="#Footnote_653" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 653.">[653]</a> The old king’s
pleasure in his two little grandchildren was great enough to
keep him lingering on in Normandy with them and their
mother, leaving England to the care of Bishop Roger, till
the middle of the following year,<a id="Anchor_654" href="#Footnote_654" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 654.">[654]</a> when there came tidings
of disturbance on the Welsh border which made him feel it
was time he should return.<a id="Anchor_655" href="#Footnote_655" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 655.">[655]</a> His daughter however set
herself against his departure. Her policy is not very clear;
but it seems impossible to acquit her of playing a double
game and secretly instigating her husband to attack her
father while the latter was living with her in unsuspecting
intimacy and confidence. Geoffrey now suddenly
put forth a claim to certain castles in Normandy which
he asserted had been promised to him at his marriage.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270">270</a></span><a id="Anchor_656" href="#Footnote_656" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 656.">[656]</a>
Henry denied the claim; the Angevin temper burst forth
at once; Geoffrey attacked and burned the castle of
Beaumont, whose lord was like himself a son-in-law of
Henry, and altogether behaved with such insulting violence
that the king in his wrath was on the point of taking
Matilda, who was with him at Rouen all the while,
back with him to England. But he now found it impossible
to leave Normandy. The land was full of treason;
many barons who only disguised their real feelings from
awe of the stern old king had been gained over in secret
to the Angevin cause; among those whose fidelity was
most suspected were Roger of Toëny and William
Talvas the lord of Alençon, who had been restored to
the forfeited estates of his family at the intercession
of Geoffrey’s father in 1119. Roger’s castle of Conches
was garrisoned by the king; William Talvas was
summoned to Rouen more than once, but the conscious
traitor dared not shew his face; at last Henry again seized
his estates, and then, in September, Talvas fled across the
border to be received with open arms by the count of
Anjou.<a id="Anchor_657" href="#Footnote_657" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 657.">[657]</a> The countess pleaded warmly with her father for
the traitor’s pardon, but in vain. When she found him
inexorable, she suddenly threw off the mask and shewed on
which side her real sympathies lay by parting from the
king in anger and going home to her husband at Angers.<a id="Anchor_658" href="#Footnote_658" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 658.">[658]</a>
Father and daughter never met again. In the last week of
November Henry fell sick while hunting in the Forest of
Lions; feeling his end near, he sent for his old friend Archbishop
Hugh of Rouen to receive his confession and give
him the last sacraments. His son Earl Robert of Gloucester
hurried to the spot at the first tidings of his illness; his
daughter made no sign of a wish for reconciliation; yet
when the earl and the primate asked for his final instructions
concerning the succession to the crown, he remained
true to his cherished purpose and once more bequeathed all
his dominions on both sides of the sea to Matilda and her<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271">271</a></span>
heirs for ever.<a id="Anchor_659" href="#Footnote_659" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 659.">[659]</a> He died on the night of December 1,
1135.<a id="Anchor_660" href="#Footnote_660" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 660.">[660]</a></p>

<p>With him expired the direct male line of the Conqueror;

Of the nine children of William the Conqueror and Matilda
of Flanders, the youngest and the last survivor was now
gone, leaving as his sole representatives his daughter the
countess of Anjou and her infant boys. By a thrice-repeated
oath the barons of Normandy and England stood pledged
to acknowledge her as their sovereign. Suddenly there
sprang forth an unexpected competitor. A rivalry which
had seemed dead for nearly a hundred years revived in a
new form; and the house of Anjou, on the very eve of
its triumph, found itself once more face to face with the
deadliest of its early foes—the house of Blois.</p>

<p>Since Geoffrey Martel’s victory over Theobald <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> in
1044 the counts of Blois have ceased to play a prominent
part in our story. Theobald himself accepted his defeat as
final; he seems indeed to have been almost crushed by it,
for he scarcely makes any further appearance in history,
save at his brother Stephen’s death in 1047, when he
requited the help which Stephen had given him against
Anjou by turning his son out of Champagne and appropriating
all his possessions. The injured heir took refuge
in Normandy, married the Conqueror’s sister, and afterwards
found in England such ample compensation for what he
had lost that neither he nor his posterity ever made any
attempt to regain their continental heritage. The reunion
of Champagne thus helped to repair the fortunes of the elder
line of Blois, so severely shattered by the blows of the
Angevin Hammer; and the ill-gotten gain prospered so far
that some thirty-five years later Theobald’s son and successor—the
young Count Stephen-Henry who in 1069 received<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272">272</a></span>
Fulk Rechin’s homage for Touraine—could venture on
aspiring to the hand of King William’s daughter Adela.<a id="Anchor_662" href="#Footnote_662" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 662.">[662]</a>
In winning her he won a prize of which he was scarcely
worthy. Stephen-Henry was indeed, in every way, a better
man than either his father or his grandfather; but he had
the nerveless, unstable temper which was the curse of his
race. He went on the Crusade, and deserted before Antioch
was won. He came home to bury his shame; his wife
sent him out again to expiate it. Her burning words
changed the coward into a martyr, and the stain was washed
out in his life-blood beneath the walls of Ramah.<a id="Anchor_663" href="#Footnote_663" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 663.">[663]</a> In the
ordinary course of things, his successor in the counties of
Blois, Chartres and Champagne would have been his eldest
son William. But Stephen had left the entire control of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273">273</a></span>
his affairs, including the disposal of his territories, to his
wife; and Adela knew that her firstborn was a youth of
slow wit, quite unfit for public life. She therefore disinherited
him, to his own complete satisfaction; for he
had sense enough to be conscious of his incapacity for
government, and gladly withdrew to the more congenial life
of a simple country gentleman on the estates of his wife,
the lady of Sully in Champagne, while the duties and
responsibilities of the head of the family were laid on the
abler shoulders of his next brother, Theobald. Of the two
remaining brothers, the youngest had been from his infancy
dedicated to the Church; the third, who bore his father’s
name of Stephen, had been intrusted for education to his
uncle the king of England.<a id="Anchor_664" href="#Footnote_664" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 664.">[664]</a> Adela seems to have been
Henry’s favourite sister; she was certainly, in all qualities
both of heart and head, well worthy of his confidence and
esteem; and she once at least did him a service which
deserved his utmost gratitude, for it was she who contrived
the opportunity for his reconciliation with <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Anselm. She
was moreover the only one of his sisters who had children;
and the relation between a man and his sister’s son was in
the Middle Ages held as a specially dear and sacred tie.
Its force was fully acknowledged by Henry in the case of
the little Stephen. He had the child carefully brought up
at his court with his own son; he knighted him with his
own hand, and bestowed on him, in addition to ample
estates in England, the Norman county of Mortain, which
had been for several generations held by a near connexion
of the ducal house, and entitled its possessor to rank as the
first baron of the duchy. Finally, some few years before
the second marriage of the Empress, he arranged a match
between Stephen and another Matilda of scarcely less
illustrious descent—the only daughter and heiress of Count
Eustace of Boulogne and Mary of Scotland, sister to
Henry’s own queen.<a id="Anchor_665" href="#Footnote_665" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 665.">[665]</a> Stephen seems in fact to have been,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274">274</a></span>
next to William the Ætheling, the person for whom Henry
cared most; and after the disaster of the White Ship—in
which a lucky attack of illness saved him from sharing—he
became virtually the king’s adoptive son, and the first
layman in the kingdom. His position is illustrated by a
dispute which occurred when the barons took the oath of
homage and fealty to Matilda in the Christmas council of
1126. They swore in order of precedence. The first place
among the lay peers belonged as an unquestioned right to
the king of Scots; the second was claimed at once by
Stephen and by the king’s son Earl Robert of Gloucester;
the dignity of the nephew was held to outweigh the privilege
of the son; and the second layman who swore on bended
knee to acknowledge the Empress Matilda as her father’s
successor was her cousin Count Stephen of Mortain and
Boulogne.<a id="Anchor_666" href="#Footnote_666" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 666.">[666]</a></p>

The story of this wooing is curious, and linked in a curious fashion to the
old days when Fulk Nerra and Odo were fighting for Touraine. Gelduin, the
“devil of Saumur,” when Odo’s mistaken tactics and his own loyal service had
cost him the loss of his heritage, refused all the offers of compensation made to
him by his penitent count, and merely asked him for a certain “bare hill” on
the south bank of the Loire, half way between Amboise and Blois, where he
built the castle afterwards known as Chaumont, and there remained as a perpetual
thorn in the side of the Angevin lords of Amboise, till in 1035 he gave up his
possessions to his son Geoffrey and went to end his days in peace in an abbey
which he had founded on an estate of his own, hard by the battle-field of Pontlevoy.
Geoffrey’s delicate beauty won him the surname of “the Maiden,” but beneath
his girl-like face lay a spirit as manly and as noble as that of his father. In 1066
the hot northern blood in his veins drove him to give up his estates to his niece
Dionysia (who married a son of Lisoy of Amboise) and join the host of adventurers
who followed Duke William over sea. But after fifteen years of prosperity in
England, his heart was still true to the race whom his father had served so loyally;
and it was Geoffrey’s well-earned influence with the Conqueror which brought
about, in 1082, the marriage between the son of his former lord and the daughter
of his present one

After the Conqueror’s death Geoffrey found the state of things in England no
longer to his mind, made over his estates there to his nephew Savaric, and came
home once more, to be received with open arms by the couple whom he had
helped to marry. He dwelt at their court as an honoured guest for the rest of his
days, lived to complete his hundredth year without the loss of a single faculty save
the light of his still beautiful eyes, and was buried at last by his father’s side in the
abbey of our Lady of Pontlevoy

<p>But for that council and its oath, the succession both to
the English crown and to the Norman ducal coronet would
have been at Henry’s death an open question. Had
Matilda’s child been old enough to step at once into the
place destined for him by his grandfather, there would most
likely have been no question at all; Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> would have
succeeded Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> without opposition, and England would
have been spared nineteen years of anarchy. But Henry
Fitz-Empress was not yet three years old. The practical
choice at the moment lay between the surviving adult descendants
of the Conqueror; and of these there were, besides
the Empress, at least two others who might be considered
quite as well qualified to represent him as she was. Independently
of any special engagement, the barons would be
fully entitled to choose between the daughter of William’s
son and the sons of his daughter—between Matilda of
Anjou, Theobald of Blois, and Stephen of Boulogne. Of
the three, Matilda was on the whole the one who had least
to recommend her. Her great personal advantage was that
she, and she alone, was the child of a crowned king and
queen, of the “good Queen Maude” in whose veins flowed
the ancient royal blood of Wessex, and the king whom his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275">275</a></span>
English subjects revered after he was gone as “a good man,”
who “made peace for men and deer.”<a id="Anchor_667" href="#Footnote_667" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 667.">[667]</a> Matilda’s birth would
be a valuable qualification in English eyes; but it would
carry very little weight in Normandy. Old-English blood-royal
went for nothing there; and King Henry’s good peace
had been much less successfully enforced, and when enforced
much less appreciated, in the duchy than in the kingdom.
Personally, Matilda was almost a stranger in both countries.
She had left her own people and her father’s house at the
age of eight years, to be educated not as the daughter of the
English king but as the child-wife of the Emperor. All her
associations, all her interests, were in Germany; there she
was known and respected, there she was at home. She had
only returned to England very unwillingly for a couple of
years, and then left it again to become the wife of a man
known there only as the son of that “earl of Anjou” who
had been King Henry’s most troublesome foe; while in
Normandy the Angevin was known but too well, and hated
with a mingled hate and scorn which had grown with the
growth and strengthened with the strength of both county
and duchy ever since the days of Geoffrey Martel. If the
principle of female succession was to be admitted at all—if
the Conqueror’s throne was to be filled by a stranger—one
of his daughter’s sons might fill it at least as worthily as his
son’s daughter and her Angevin husband. And if a sovereign
was to be chosen for his personal qualifications, it
would have been hard to find a better choice than Theobald
the Great, count of Blois, Chartres and Champagne. He
did not owe his historical epithet solely to his vast possessions;
he was almost the only member of the house of
Blois who shewed any trace of intellectual or moral greatness.
His public life was one long series of vexations and
disappointments; the misfortunes which his race were so apt
to bring upon themselves by their own unsteadiness and
self-will seemed to fall upon him without provocation on his
part; it was as if his heritage had come to him charged with
the penalties of all his forefathers’ errors. But it had not
come to him charged with the heavier burthen of their fatal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276">276</a></span>
intellectual perversity and moral weakness. In its place he
had the tact, the dignity, the stedfastness of his Norman
mother; and the whole of his after-career fully justified the
esteem of the Norman barons, grounded upon their acquaintance
with his person and character during those wars against
the king of France in which his cause had been inseparably
bound up with that of his uncle Henry. In England, however,
he could only be known by report, as the nephew and
ally of the king, and the elder brother of Stephen. It was
Stephen, not Theobald, who had been the king’s favourite
and constant companion, lacking nothing of the rank of an
adoptive son save the avowed prospect of the crown.
Stephen had lived in England from his childhood; his territorial
possessions, his personal interests, lay wholly in England
and Normandy; his name and his face were almost as
familiar there as those of Henry himself; he was the first
baron of the duchy, the first layman of the kingdom; moreover,
he was the husband of a lady who stood as near to the
Old-English royal line and represented it, to say the least,
as worthily as her imperial cousin and namesake. Lastly,
his marriage gave him yet one more advantage, slight in
itself, but of no small practical use at the moment. As
count of Boulogne, he had immediate command of the
shortest passage from the Continent to England.</p>

<p>The tidings of Henry’s death soon reached Angers; and
before the first week of December was out, Matilda presented
herself in Normandy to take possession of her inheritance.
The officer in charge of the border-territories, comprising
the forfeited lands of William Talvas and the county of
Hiesmes, at once surrendered them to her and received her
as his liege lady;<a id="Anchor_668" href="#Footnote_668" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 668.">[668]</a> but before she had time to secure the
duchy, the kingdom was snatched from her grasp. Stephen

<p>Stephen’s promptitude served him as well as the promptitude
of William Rufus and Henry had served them in a
like case. But this time the part which had been played in
1087 by the primate and in 1100 by “the Witan who were
there nigh at hand” was to be played by the citizens of
London. Repulsed from Dover and Canterbury<a id="Anchor_670" href="#Footnote_670" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 670.">[670]</a>—for the
men of Kent had an hereditary grudge against any one
coming from Boulogne—Stephen pushed on to London,
where the well-known face of King Henry’s favourite nephew
was hailed with delight by the citizens, vehemently declaring
that they would have no stranger to rule over them.<a id="Anchor_671" href="#Footnote_671" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 671.">[671]</a> They
claimed to have inherited the right to a voice in the election
of the sovereign which had once, in theory at least, belonged
to the whole nation, and accordingly the “aldermen and
wise folk”<a id="Anchor_672" href="#Footnote_672" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 672.">[672]</a> came together to consider what provision should
be made for the safety of the realm, and, for that end, to
choose a king. A kingless land, said they, was exposed to
countless perils; the first thing needful was to make a king
as speedily as possible.<a id="Anchor_673" href="#Footnote_673" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 673.">[673]</a> Of Matilda and her claims not a
word seems to have been said; if any of the leading burgesses,
as tenants-in-chief of the crown, had sworn fealty to
her, they were in no humour to regard it now; and the
citizens in general would doubtless not hold themselves
bound by an oath which they had not personally taken.
They claimed the right of election as their special prerogative,
and exercising it without more ado in favour of the only
person then at hand whose birth and character fitted him to
undertake the defence of the kingdom, and who seemed to
have been sent to them as by a special providence in their
hour of need, they by common consent acknowledged Stephen
as king. He hurried to Winchester to get possession of the
treasury; the bishop—his own brother—came forth with
the chief citizens to meet him; and the treasurer, who had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278">278</a></span>
refused to give up his keys to the bishop, surrendered them
at once to the king-elect.<a id="Anchor_674" href="#Footnote_674" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 674.">[674]</a></p>

<p>Thus far the two men who ought to have taken the lead
in the national counsels—the primate and the justiciar—had
stood looking passively on. Both now joined Stephen.<a id="Anchor_675" href="#Footnote_675" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 675.">[675]</a>
He lacked nothing to make him full king but the rite of
coronation. This however depended on the primate, and
when called upon to perform it William of Canterbury again
drew back. He had scruples, first, about the oath which he
himself, as well as Stephen and all the barons, had sworn to
the Empress Matilda; and secondly, about the validity of
an election so hastily made by a small part only of the
nation. The second objection passed unheeded; to the
first Stephen’s adherents answered that the oath had been
extorted and was therefore not binding, and that several
persons who were with Henry at his death had heard him
openly express repentance for having forced it upon the
barons.<a id="Anchor_676" href="#Footnote_676" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 676.">[676]</a> Roger of Salisbury affirmed that it was annulled
in another way; it had been sworn, by him at least, on condition
of a promise from Henry that he would not give his
daughter in marriage out of the realm without the consent
of the Great Council—a promise which had been immediately
broken.<a id="Anchor_677" href="#Footnote_677" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 677.">[677]</a> Hugh Bigod, too, the late king’s seneschal, declared
upon oath that Henry had in his presence solemnly absolved
the barons from their engagement,<a id="Anchor_678" href="#Footnote_678" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 678.">[678]</a> and had even formally
disinherited Matilda and designated Stephen as his successor.<a id="Anchor_679" href="#Footnote_679" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 679.">[679]</a>
The argument which really prevailed, however,
was the objection to a woman’s rule, and the urgent need of
having a man to take the government, and to take it at
once.<a id="Anchor_680" href="#Footnote_680" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 680.">[680]</a> Henry had not yet been three weeks dead, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279">279</a></span>
already England was in confusion. The first outcome of
the reaction against his stern control had been a general
raid upon the forests; and when men in their frantic
vehemence had left themselves no more game to hunt,
they turned their arms against each other and trampled all
law and order under foot.<a id="Anchor_681" href="#Footnote_681" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 681.">[681]</a> Such a state of things, resulting
solely from the fact that England had been three weeks
without a king, spoke more in Stephen’s favour than any
amount of legal reasonings. The archbishop gave way; all
that he demanded from Stephen was a promise to restore
and maintain the liberties of the Church. Bishop Henry of
Winchester offered himself as surety in his brother’s behalf,
and thereby won him the crown.<a id="Anchor_682" href="#Footnote_682" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 682.">[682]</a> He received it at Westminster,<a id="Anchor_683" href="#Footnote_683" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 683.">[683]</a>
probably either on the last Sunday in Advent or
on Christmas day,<a id="Anchor_684" href="#Footnote_684" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 684.">[684]</a> and he issued at the same time, by way
of coronation-charter, a promise at once comprehensive and
vague, to maintain the laws established by his predecessor.<a id="Anchor_685" href="#Footnote_685" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 685.">[685]</a></p>

and then there would be another witness for Christmas-day.

<p>Thus the two great feuds which had hitherto influenced
the political career of the Angevin house—the feud with
Blois and the feud with Normandy—merged at last into one.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280">280</a></span>
The successors of Odo of Blois and those of William the
Conqueror were now both represented, as against the
successors of Fulk Nerra and Geoffrey Martel, by one and
the same man, who yet was not, in strict law, the nearest representative
of either. We shall see hereafter that some of the
Normans entertained a project of making Theobald their
duke; had they succeeded, the older quarrel would have
revived almost in its original form, as a direct conflict
between the heads of the two rival houses, only with
Normandy instead of Touraine for its object and its battle-ground.
Its original spirit was, however, more likely to be
revived, on one side at least, by the substitution of Stephen for
Theobald. Stephen had renounced all share in his father’s
territories; but there was one paternal heir-loom which he
could not renounce, and which descended to him, and him
alone, among the sons of Stephen-Henry and Adela. This
was the peculiar mental and moral constitution which the
house of Blois inherited from Odo <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> as surely as the
Angevins inherited theirs from Fulk the Black. In the
reigning Count Theobald, indeed, the type was fortunately
almost lost, and in his youngest brother, Bishop Henry of
Winchester, it was very greatly modified by the infusion of
Norman blood derived from their mother. In Stephen,
however, the Norman blood had but little influence on a
nature which in its essence was that of the old counts of
Blois. All the characteristic qualities and defects of the race
were there, just as deeply rooted as in Odo of Champagne
himself; the whole difference lay in this, that in Stephen
the qualities lay uppermost and shewed themselves in their
most attractive aspect, while the defects took a form so mild
that till their fatal consequences were seen they appeared
hardly more than amiable weaknesses. Gallant knight and
courteous gentleman; warm-hearted, high-spirited, throwing
himself eagerly into every enterprise; all reckless valour in
the battle-field, all gentleness and mercy as soon as the fight
was over; open-handed, generous, gracious to all, and apparently
unstained by any personal vices<span class="nobreak">:—</span>it is easy to understand
Henry’s affection for him, and the high hopes with
which at the opening of his career he was regarded by all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281">281</a></span>
classes in the realm.<a id="Anchor_686" href="#Footnote_686" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 686.">[686]</a> His good qualities were plainly visible;
time and experience alone could reveal the radical defect which
vitiated them all. That defect was simply the old curse of his
race—lack of stedfastness; and it ruined Stephen as surely
as it had ruined Odo. It was ingrained in every fibre of his
nature; it acted like an incurable moral disease, mingling its
subtle poison with his every thought and act, and turning his
very virtues into weaknesses; it reduced his whole kingly
career to a mere string of political inconsistencies and
blunders; and it wrecked him at last, as it had wrecked his
great-grandfather, on the rock of the Angevin thoroughness.</p>

<p>For the moment, however, Stephen had outstripped his
rival. The Angevin sagacity had been for once at fault.
Steeped as were both Geoffrey and his wife in continental
ideas and feelings, their first thought was of Normandy, and
they had failed to see that in order to secure it their true
policy was to secure England first; or rather, perhaps, they
had failed to see that the mere will of the late king was
not sufficient to give them undisputed possession of both.
Stephen’s bold stroke, whether it resulted from a closer
acquaintance with the relation between the two countries, or
simply from a characteristic impulse to dash straight at the
highest object in view, gained him kingdom and duchy at
one blow. Geoffrey had followed his wife into Normandy at
the head of an armed force, and accompanied by William
Talvas, whose influence secured him a welcome at Séez and
in all the territories of the house of Alençon. But the rival
races were no sooner in actual contact than their old hatred
burst uncontrollably forth. The Angevins, though they
ostensibly came only to put their countess in peaceful
possession of her heritage, could not yet bring themselves to
look upon the Normans in any light but that of natural
enemies; they treated the districts which had submitted to
them as a conquered land, and went about harrying and
plundering till the people rose and attacked them with such
fury that they were compelled to evacuate the country.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282">282</a></span><a id="Anchor_687" href="#Footnote_687" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 687.">[687]</a>
The Norman barons now held at Neubourg a meeting at
which they decided to invite Count Theobald of Blois to
come and take possession of the duchy. Theobald came to
Rouen, and thence to Lisieux, where on December 21 he
had an interview with Matilda’s half-brother Earl Robert of
Gloucester. They were interrupted by a messenger from
England with the tidings of Stephen’s election as king.<a id="Anchor_688" href="#Footnote_688" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 688.">[688]</a>
The Norman barons then felt that the decision was taken
out of their hands; since Stephen and England had been
too quick for them, their best course now was to accept the
accomplished fact, and acknowledged the king-elect as duke
of Normandy.<a id="Anchor_689" href="#Footnote_689" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 689.">[689]</a> To this Robert of Gloucester assented.<a id="Anchor_690" href="#Footnote_690" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 690.">[690]</a>
Theobald, despite his natural vexation, at once withdrew his
claim, and made in his brother’s name a truce with Geoffrey to
last from Christmas till the octave of Pentecost; and having
thus done his best to secure the peace of the duchy till its
own duke could come to it, he quietly returned to his own
dominions.<a id="Anchor_691" href="#Footnote_691" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 691.">[691]</a></p>

<p>In England, meanwhile, Stephen was carrying all before
him. The first public act in which he had to take part as
king was the burial of his predecessor at Reading on the
feast of the Epiphany;<a id="Anchor_692" href="#Footnote_692" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 692.">[692]</a> the next was the defence of his
realm against a danger which it had not known for more
than forty years—a Scottish invasion. King David of
Scotland, true to the oath which every one else seemed to
have forgotten, arose as the champion of Matilda’s rights,
led his troops into Northumberland, and partly conquered it
in her behalf. Stephen met him near Durham, pacified him
by a grant of the earldoms of Carlisle, Huntingdon and
Doncaster to his son Henry,<a id="Anchor_693" href="#Footnote_693" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 693.">[693]</a> and came back in peace,
almost in triumph, to the Easter festival and the crowning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283">283</a></span>
of his queen.<a id="Anchor_694" href="#Footnote_694" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 694.">[694]</a> Adherents now came flocking in; the
splendour of the Easter court made up for the meagreness
of the Christmas meeting.<a id="Anchor_695" href="#Footnote_695" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 695.">[695]</a> Baron and knight, clerk and
layman, rallied round the winning young sovereign who was
ready to promise anything, to undertake anything, to please
anybody. The only class who still held aloof were the
“new men” of the last reign, men like Payne Fitz-John
and Miles the sheriff of Gloucester, who owed everything to
Henry, and who were bound alike by gratitude and by policy
to uphold his daughter’s cause. But the chief of them all,
Bishop Roger of Salisbury, had already joined Stephen, and
the rest were soon persuaded to follow his example.<a id="Anchor_696" href="#Footnote_696" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 696.">[696]</a> Shortly
after Easter there came in a yet more important personage.
Earl Robert of Gloucester, the eldest son of the late king,
influential alike on both sides of the sea by his rank, his
wealth and his character, was looked upon both in Normandy
and in England as the natural leader of the baronage.
The suddenness of Stephen’s accession had snatched the
leadership out of his hands, and he lingered on in Normandy,
watching the course of events without sharing in
them, and meditating how to reconcile his own interest with
his duty to his sister. Stephen, anxious to win him over,
sent him repeated invitations to England; till at last he
decided to let himself be won, at least in appearance, if
only for the sake of gaining a footing in England which
might enable him afterwards to work there in Matilda’s
favour. The king’s son, however, made terms for himself
more like a king than a mere earl. He came to Stephen’s
court and did homage for his English estates; but he did
it only on the express condition of being bound by it only
so long as Stephen’s own promises to him were kept, and he
himself was maintained in all his honours and dignities.<a id="Anchor_697" href="#Footnote_697" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 697.">[697]</a>
The first result of his submission—if submission it can be
called—was seen in a great council at Oxford, where all the
bishops swore fealty to the king, and the vague promise to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284">284</a></span>
maintain the “Laws of King Henry,” which Stephen had
issued on his coronation-day, was amplified into a more
detailed and definite charter.<a id="Anchor_698" href="#Footnote_698" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 698.">[698]</a> Suddenly, a few weeks later,
there went forth a rumour that the king was dead, and the
barons at once broke into revolt. Baldwin of Redvers
threw himself into Exeter; Hugh Bigod, who but a few
months ago had been foremost among the supporters of
Stephen, seized Norwich castle, and was only dislodged by
the king in person.<a id="Anchor_699" href="#Footnote_699" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 699.">[699]</a> He was apparently forgiven; another
rebel, Robert of Bathenton,<a id="Anchor_700" href="#Footnote_700" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 700.">[700]</a> was caught and hanged, and
his castle forced to surrender. The great castle of Exeter,
where Baldwin had shut himself up with his family and a
picked band of young knights, all sworn never to yield, cost
a long and troublesome siege; but the agonies of thirst at
length drove the garrison to break their vow and ask for
terms. Stephen let them all go out free; Baldwin requited
his leniency by hastening to a castle which he possessed in
the Isle of Wight, and there setting himself up as a sort of
pirate-chief at the head of a band of men as reckless as
himself. But when Stephen hurried to Southampton and
began to collect a fleet, Baldwin suddenly took fright and
surrendered. His lands were confiscated, and he went into
exile in Anjou, where he was eagerly welcomed by the
count, and added one more to the elements of strife already
working in Normandy.<a id="Anchor_701" href="#Footnote_701" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 701.">[701]</a> In England his defeat put an end
to the revolt, and the Christmas court at Dunstable brought
the first year of King Stephen to a tranquil close.<a id="Anchor_702" href="#Footnote_702" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 702.">[702]</a></p>

<p>Yet already there were signs that those who had thought
to find in Henry’s nephew such another king as Henry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285">285</a></span>
himself<a id="Anchor_703" href="#Footnote_703" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 703.">[703]</a> were doomed to disappointment. It was no good
omen for the fulfilment of the pledges embodied in his
charters when Stephen broke the one which appealed most
strongly to popular feeling—the promise to mitigate the
severe forest laws—by holding a forest assize at Brampton
after his triumph over Baldwin of Redvers in 1136.<a id="Anchor_704" href="#Footnote_704" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 704.">[704]</a>
Neither was it satisfactory that the accession of a king
specially bound by the circumstances of his election to rule
as a national sovereign proved to be the signal for a great
influx of foreigners—not as in Henry’s time, honest industrious
settlers who fled from their own unquiet homes to
share “the good peace that he made in this land” and to
become an useful element in the growing prosperity of the
nation; but as in the Red King’s time, a rapacious and
violent race of mercenary adventurers, chiefly from Britanny
and Flanders; men to whom nothing was sacred, and who
flocked to Stephen as they had flocked to Rufus, attracted
by the report of his prodigality and the hope, only too well
founded, of growing rich upon the spoils of England.<a id="Anchor_705" href="#Footnote_705" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 705.">[705]</a>
However much Henry may have provoked his subjects by
his preference for ministers of continental birth, he had at
least never insulted them by taking for his chief counsellor
and confidant a mere foreign soldier of fortune like that
William of Ypres who acted as the leader of Stephen’s
Flemish mercenaries and whose influence over him excited
the wrath of both the English and the Norman barons.<a id="Anchor_706" href="#Footnote_706" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 706.">[706]</a>
The peace of the country was probably all the better kept<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286">286</a></span>
during the year 1137 because its preservation was left
wholly to Bishop Roger and his nephews, while Stephen,
accompanied by his Flemish friend, was well out of the way
in Normandy, where he spent the year in concerting an
alliance with his brother,<a id="Anchor_707" href="#Footnote_707" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 707.">[707]</a> obtaining the French king’s
sanction to his tenure of the duchy, for which his eldest son
did homage in his stead,<a id="Anchor_708" href="#Footnote_708" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 708.">[708]</a> and vainly endeavouring to secure
it from the combined dangers of internal treason and
Angevin intermeddling. No disturbance occurred in England
during his absence; a Scottish invasion, threatened
soon after Easter, was averted by Archbishop Thurstan of
York, who persuaded the Scot king to accept a truce till
Advent,<a id="Anchor_709" href="#Footnote_709" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 709.">[709]</a> when Stephen was expected to return. He was
no sooner back than David sent to demand for his son the
earldom of Northumberland,<a id="Anchor_710" href="#Footnote_710" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 710.">[710]</a> which had been, it was said,

demand,<a id="Anchor_712" href="#Footnote_712" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 712.">[712]</a> early in January he led an army into England.
An unsuccessful siege of the border fortress of Carham or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287">287</a></span>
Wark was followed by such a harrying of the whole land
from Tweed to Tyne as had not been heard of since the
wild heathenish days of Malcolm Canmore’s youth.<a id="Anchor_713" href="#Footnote_713" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 713.">[713]</a> David,
indeed, was not personally concerned in this horrible work;
he had left it to the conduct of his nephew William Fitz-Duncan,
while he himself with a strong body of troops took
up his quarters at Corbridge.<a id="Anchor_714" href="#Footnote_714" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 714.">[714]</a> Stephen marched against
him early in February, whereupon he returned to the siege
of Carham; dislodged thence by the English king, he buried
himself and his troops in an almost inaccessible swamp near
Roxburgh, bidding the townsfolk decoy the Southrons by a
false show of friendliness and thus enable him to surround
and despatch them.<a id="Anchor_715" href="#Footnote_715" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 715.">[715]</a> Stephen however discovered the trap—apparently
through the double treachery of some of his
own barons who were concerned in it;<a id="Anchor_716" href="#Footnote_716" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 716.">[716]</a> he crossed the
Tweed, but instead of marching upon Roxburgh he turned
south-westward and ravaged David’s territories till the lack
of provisions forced him to return to the south.<a id="Anchor_717" href="#Footnote_717" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 717.">[717]</a></p>

William of Ypres was son of Philip
of Flanders, second son of Count Robert the Frisian. Although he had no legal
place in the house of Flanders, he was one of the claimants of the county after
the death of Charles of Denmark, against William the Clito and Theodoric of
Alsace. After being the torment of his own country for nearly ten years, he was
compelled to fly, and took service in England under Stephen. See

The people’s hatred of William was justifiable enough; but it ill
became the barons to cast stones at him. His evil-doings were not a whit greater
than theirs, and the changeless devotion with which he—a mere hireling, bound
to Stephen by no tie but that of a bargain which Stephen certainly cannot long
have had means to fulfil—stuck to the king in adversity as firmly as in prosperity,
might have put them all to shame.

made between Stephen and David in 1136 affirmed that Stephen had then
promised that if ever he should contemplate bestowing the earldom of Northumberland
upon any man, he would first cause to be fairly tried in his court the
claims upon it which Henry of Scotland had inherited from his mother, the eldest
daughter of the last old English earl, Waltheof.

According to Orderic, Stephen had some ground for his refusal; for it seems
that the form in which the lately expired truce reached him—at any rate, that in
which it reached Orderic—was that of a plot made by “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">quidam pestiferi</span>” to kill
all the Normans in England on a certain day, and betray the realm to the Scots.
Some of the plotters were said to have confessed to Bishop Nigel of Ely, who
revealed the plot, and so it all came out.

<p>He had not long turned his back when David re-entered
Northumberland and marched ravaging along the eastern
coast till a mutiny among his soldiers compelled him to
retreat to the border. Thence he sent William Fitz-Duncan
to ravage the district of Craven, while he himself remained
busy with the siege of Carham till he was dislodged by

<p>There was no help to be looked for from the king. All
through that summer the whole south and west of England
had been in a blaze of revolt which was still unsubdued, and
Stephen had neither time, thought, nor troops to spare for
the defence of the north. But in face of such a danger as
this the men of the north needed no help from him. When
their own hearths and altars were threatened by the
hereditary Scottish foe, resistance was a matter not of
loyalty but of patriotism. The barons and great men of the
shire at once organized their plans under the guidance of
Archbishop Thurstan, whose lightest word carried more
weight in Yorkshire than anything that Stephen could have
said or done. Inspired by him, the forces of the diocese met
at York in the temper of crusaders. Three days of fasting,
almsgiving and penance, concluding with a solemn absolution
and benediction from their primate, prepared them for
their task. Worn out as he was with years and labours—so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289">289</a></span>
feeble that he could neither walk nor ride—Thurstan would
yet have gone forth in his litter at the head of his men to
encourage the host with his presence and his eloquence; but
the barons shrank from such a risk. To them he was the
Moses on whose uplifted hands depended their success in the
coming battle; so they sent him back to wrestle in prayer
for them within his own cathedral church, while they went
forth to their earthly warfare against the Scot.<a id="Anchor_723" href="#Footnote_723" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 723.">[723]</a></p>

of the Orkneys;<a id="Anchor_725" href="#Footnote_725" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 725.">[725]</a> their chief military adviser was Walter
Lespec, the pious and noble founder of Kirkham and
Rievaux—the very type and model of a Christian knight of
the time. Standing upon the cart, with the sacred banners
waving round his head, in a voice like a trumpet he
addressed his comrades.<a id="Anchor_726" href="#Footnote_726" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 726.">[726]</a> He appealed to the barons to
prove themselves worthy of their race; he appealed to the
English shire-levies to prove themselves worthy of their
country; he pictured in glowing colours the wrongs which
they all had to avenge, and the worse they would have to
suffer if they survived a defeat; then, grasping the hand of
William of Aumale, the new-made earl of York,<a id="Anchor_727" href="#Footnote_727" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 727.">[727]</a> he swore
aloud to conquer or die.<a id="Anchor_728" href="#Footnote_728" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 728.">[728]</a> The unanimous “Amen!” of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290">290</a></span>
English host was answered by shrill cries of “Albin! Albin!”
as the Scots came charging on.<a id="Anchor_729" href="#Footnote_729" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 729.">[729]</a> The glory of the first onset
was snatched, much against David’s will, by the men of
Galloway, who claimed it as their hereditary right.<a id="Anchor_730" href="#Footnote_730" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 730.">[730]</a> The
second division of the Scottish host comprised the Cumbrians
and the men of Teviotdale, and the followers of Eustace
Fitz-John. A third body was formed by the men of Lothian
and of the western islands, and a fourth by the king’s household
troops, a picked band of English and Norman knights
commanded by David in person.<a id="Anchor_731" href="#Footnote_731" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 731.">[731]</a> The English array was
simple enough; the whole host stood in one compact mass
clustered around the Standard,—the barons and their
followers occupying the centre, the archers intermingled with
them in front, and the general mass of less well-armed troops
of the shire in the rear, with a small detachment of horse
posted at a little distance; the main body of both armies
fought on foot in the old English fashion. The wild Celts
of Galloway dashed headlong upon the English front, only
to find their spears and javelins glance off from the helmets
and shields of the knights as from an iron wall, while their
own half-naked bodies were riddled with a shower of arrows;
their leader fell, and they fled in confusion.<a id="Anchor_732" href="#Footnote_732" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 732.">[732]</a> The second
line under the king’s son, Henry, charged with better
success; but an Englishman lifted up a gory head upon a
pole crying out that it was David’s; and like the English
long ago in a like case at Assandun, the Scottish centre at
once fled almost without waiting to be attacked.<a id="Anchor_733" href="#Footnote_733" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 733.">[733]</a> David
himself fought on well-nigh alone, till the few who stood
around him dragged him off the field, lifted him on horseback<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291">291</a></span>,
and fairly compelled him to retreat.<a id="Anchor_734" href="#Footnote_734" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 734.">[734]</a> His scattered
troops caught sight of the dragon on his standard,<a id="Anchor_735" href="#Footnote_735" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 735.">[735]</a> and discovering
that he was still alive, rallied enough to enable him
to retreat in good order. Henry gathered up the remnants
of the royal body-guard—the only mounted division of the
army—and with them made a gallant effort to retrieve the
day; but the horsemen charged in vain against the English
shield-wall, and falling back with shattered spears and
wounded horses they were compelled to fling away their
accoutrements and escape as best they could.<a id="Anchor_736" href="#Footnote_736" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 736.">[736]</a> Three days
elapsed before Henry himself could rejoin his father at
Carlisle.<a id="Anchor_737" href="#Footnote_737" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 737.">[737]</a> Eleven hundred Scots were said to have been
slain in the battle or caught in their flight through the woods
and marshes and there despatched.<a id="Anchor_738" href="#Footnote_738" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 738.">[738]</a> Out of two hundred
armed knights only nineteen carried their mail-coats home
again;<a id="Anchor_739" href="#Footnote_739" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 739.">[739]</a> such of the rest as escaped at all escaped only with
their lives; and the field was so strewn with baggage, provisions
and arms, left behind by the fugitives, that the victors
gave it the nickname of Baggamore.<a id="Anchor_740" href="#Footnote_740" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 740.">[740]</a> The enthusiasm which
had carried the Yorkshiremen through the hour of danger<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292">292</a></span>
carried them also through the temptation of the hour of
triumph. They sullied their victory by no attempt at
pursuit or retaliation, but simply returned as they had come,
in solemn procession, and having restored the holy banners
to their several places with joy and thanksgiving, went
quietly back every man to his own home.<a id="Anchor_741" href="#Footnote_741" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 741.">[741]</a> Some three
months later the garrison of Carham, having salted their last
horse save one, were driven to surrender; but their stubborn
defence had won them the right to march out free with the
honours of war, and all that David gained was the satisfaction
of razing the empty fortress.<a id="Anchor_742" href="#Footnote_742" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 742.">[742]</a></p>

According to this last, the scattered eatables consisted chiefly of bread, cheese
and horseflesh, which, as well as other flesh, the Scots ate indifferently raw or
cooked.—There is yet one other curious version of the Scottish rout and its cause:

<p>The defeat of the Scots was shared by the English
baron who had brought them into the land. But Eustace
Fitz-John was far from standing alone in his breach of fealty
to the English king. All the elements of danger and disruption
which had been threatening Stephen ever since his
accession suddenly burst forth in the spring of 1138.<a id="Anchor_743" href="#Footnote_743" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 743.">[743]</a> Between
the king and the barons there had been from the first
a total lack of confidence. It could not be otherwise; for
their mutual obligations were founded on the breach of an
earlier obligation contracted by both towards Matilda and
her son. There could not fail to be on both sides a feeling
that as they had all alike broken their faith to the Empress,
so they might at any moment break their faith to each other
just as lightly. But on one side the insecurity lay still
deeper. Not only was the king not sure of his subjects;
he was not sure of himself. How far Stephen was morally
justified in accepting the crown after he had sworn fealty
to another candidate for it is a question whose solution
depends upon that of a variety of other questions which
we are not bound to discuss here. Politically, however, he
could justify himself only in one way: by proving his fitness
for the office which he had undertaken. What he proved<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293">293</a></span>
was his unfitness for it. Stephen, in short, had done the
most momentous deed of his life as he did all the lesser
ones, without first counting the cost; and it was no sooner
done than he found the cost beyond his power to meet. A
thoroughly unselfish hero, a thoroughly unscrupulous tyrant,
might have met it successfully, each in his own way.
But Stephen was neither hero nor tyrant; he was “a mild
man, soft and good—and did no justice.”<a id="Anchor_744" href="#Footnote_744" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 744.">[744]</a> His weakness
shewed itself in a policy of makeshift which only betrayed
his uneasiness and increased his difficulties. His first expedient
to strengthen his position had been the unlucky
introduction of the Flemish mercenaries; his next was the
creation of new earldoms in behalf of those whom he regarded
as his especial friends, whereby he hoped to raise up
an aristocracy wholly devoted to himself, but only succeeded
in provoking the resentment and contempt of the older
nobility; while to indemnify his new earls for their lack of
territorial endowment and give them some means of supporting
their titular dignity, he was obliged to provide them
with revenues charged upon that of the Crown.<a id="Anchor_745" href="#Footnote_745" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 745.">[745]</a> But his
prodigality had already made the Crown revenues insufficient
for his own needs;<a id="Anchor_746" href="#Footnote_746" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 746.">[746]</a> and the next steps were the debasement
of the coinage<a id="Anchor_747" href="#Footnote_747" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 747.">[747]</a> and the arbitrary spoliation of those whom
he mistrusted for the benefit of his insatiable favourites.<a id="Anchor_748" href="#Footnote_748" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 748.">[748]</a>
They grew greedier in asking, and he more lavish in giving;
castles, lands, anything and everything, were demanded of
him without scruple; and if their demands were not granted
the petitioners at once prepared for defiance.<a id="Anchor_749" href="#Footnote_749" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 749.">[749]</a> He flew
hither and thither, but nothing came of his restless activity;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294">294</a></span><a id="Anchor_750" href="#Footnote_750" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 750.">[750]</a>
he did more harm to himself than to his enemies, giving
away lands and honours almost at random, patching up a
hollow peace,<a id="Anchor_751" href="#Footnote_751" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 751.">[751]</a> and then, when he found every man’s hand
against him and his hand against every man, bitterly complaining,
“Why have they made me king, only to leave me
thus destitute? By our Lord’s Nativity, I will not be a
king thus disgraced!”<a id="Anchor_752" href="#Footnote_752" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 752.">[752]</a></p>

<p>Matters were made worse by his relations with Earl
Robert of Gloucester. As son of the late king and half-brother
of the Empress; as one of the greatest and wealthiest
landowners in England—earl of Gloucester by his father’s
grant, lord of Bristol and of Glamorgan by his marriage with
the heiress of Robert Fitz-Hamon—all-powerful throughout
the western shires and on the Welsh march—Robert was
the one man who above all others could most influence the
policy of the barons, and whom it was most important for
Stephen to conciliate at any cost. Robert had followed the
king back to Normandy in 1137; throughout their stay
there William of Ypres strove, only too successfully, to set
them at variance; a formal reconciliation took place, but it
was a mere form;<a id="Anchor_753" href="#Footnote_753" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 753.">[753]</a> and a few months after Stephen’s return
to England he was rash enough to order the confiscation of
the earl’s English and Welsh estates, and actually to raze
some of his castles.<a id="Anchor_754" href="#Footnote_754" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 754.">[754]</a> The consequence was that soon after
Whitsuntide Robert sent to the king a formal renunciation
of his allegiance, and to his vassals in England instructions
to prepare for war.<a id="Anchor_755" href="#Footnote_755" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 755.">[755]</a> This message proved the signal for a
general rising. Geoffrey Talbot had already seized Hereford

The grounds of the defiance
were—1, the unlawfulness of Stephen’s accession; 2, his breach of his engagements
towards Robert; 3, the unlawfulness of Robert’s own oath to him as being
invalidated, like Stephen’s claim to the crown, by the previous oath to Matilda.

marching against “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">castellum de <em>Duddelæge</em>, quod Radulf Paignel

continuator of Florence makes no mention of Ludlow till 1139, when he says
nothing of its commander, it seems plain that there has been some mistake
between the two names, which indeed might easily get confounded. Mr. Eyton
    (<cite><i>Antiquities of Shropshire</i>, <abbr title="volume 5">vol. v.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 244, 245</cite>) rules that the Continuator is
right, as there is no trace of any connexion between Ralf Paganel and Ludlow,

<p>The full force of the blow came upon Stephen while he
was endeavouring to dislodge Geoffrey Talbot from Hereford.
After a siege of nearly five weeks’ duration the town caught
fire below the bridge; the alarmed rebels offered terms, and
Stephen with his usual clemency allowed them to depart free.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296">296</a></span><a id="Anchor_765" href="#Footnote_765" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 765.">[765]</a>
After taking the neighbouring castle of Weobly, and leaving
a garrison there and another at Hereford,<a id="Anchor_766" href="#Footnote_766" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 766.">[766]</a> he seems to have
returned to London<a id="Anchor_767" href="#Footnote_767" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 767.">[767]</a> and there collected his forces for an
attack upon the insurgents in their headquarters at Bristol.
Geoffrey Talbot meanwhile made an attempt upon Bath, but
was caught and put in ward by the bishop. The latter
however was presently captured in his turn by the garrison
of Bristol, who threatened to hang him unless their friend
was released. The bishop saved his neck by giving up his
prize; Stephen in great indignation marched upon Bath,
and was, it is said, with difficulty restrained from depriving
the bishop of his ring and staff—a statement which tells
something of the way in which the king kept his compact
towards the Church. He contented himself however with
putting a garrison into Bath, and hurried on to the siege of
Bristol.<a id="Anchor_768" href="#Footnote_768" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 768.">[768]</a></p>

The writer adds that on the
very day of Stephen’s departure (June 15) Geoffrey set fire to everything beyond
the Wye; seven or eight Welshmen perished, but no English (<i><abbr title="ibid.">ib.</abbr></i> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 107)—an
indication that the part of Hereford beyond the Wye was then a Welsh quarter.

<p>A survey of its environs soon convinced him that he
had undertaken a very difficult task. Bristol with its two
encircling rivers was a natural stronghold of no common
order; and on the one side where nature had left it unprotected,
art had supplied the deficiency. The narrow neck
of land at the eastern end of the peninsula on which the
town stood—the only point whence it could be reached
without crossing the water—was in the Conqueror’s last
days occupied by a castle which in the Red King’s reign
passed into the hands of Robert Fitz-Hamon, famed alike in
history and legend as the conqueror of Glamorgan; in those
of his son-in-law and successor, Earl Robert of Gloucester,<a id="Anchor_769" href="#Footnote_769" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 769.">[769]</a> it
grew into a mighty fortress, provided with trench and wall,
outworks and towers, and all other military contrivances
then in use,<a id="Anchor_770" href="#Footnote_770" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 770.">[770]</a> and surrounded on its exposed eastern side by
a moat whose waters joined those of the Avon on the south.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297">297</a></span><a id="Anchor_771" href="#Footnote_771" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 771.">[771]</a>
Bristol was in fact Robert’s military capital, and under the
command of his eldest son it had now become the chief muster-place
of all his dispossessed partizans and followers, as well
as of a swarm of mercenaries attracted thither from all parts
of the country by the advantages of the place and the wealth
and renown of its lord.<a id="Anchor_772" href="#Footnote_772" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 772.">[772]</a> From this stronghold they sallied
forth in all directions to do the king all the mischief in their
power. They overran his lands and those of his adherents
like a pack of hounds; wholesale cattle-lifting was among
the least of their misdeeds; every wealthy man whom they
could reach was hunted down or decoyed into their den,
and there tortured with every refinement of ingenious cruelty
till he had given up his uttermost farthing.<a id="Anchor_773" href="#Footnote_773" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 773.">[773]</a> One Philip
Gay, a kinsman of Earl Robert, specially distinguished himself
in the contrivance of new methods of torture.<a id="Anchor_774" href="#Footnote_774" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 774.">[774]</a> In his
hands, and those of men like him, Bristol acquired the title
of “the stepmother of all England.”<a id="Anchor_775" href="#Footnote_775" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 775.">[775]</a> If Bristol could be
reduced to submission, Stephen’s work would be more than
half done. He held a council of war with his barons to
deliberate on the best method of beginning the siege. Those
who were in earnest about the matter urged the construction
of a mole to dam up the narrow strait which formed the
haven, whereby not only would the inhabitants be deprived
of their chief hope of succour, but the waters, checked in
their course and thrown back upon themselves, would swell
into a mighty flood and speedily overwhelm the city. Meanwhile,
added the supporters of this scheme, Stephen might
build a tower on each side of the city to check all ingress
and egress by means of the two bridges, while he himself
should encamp with his host before the castle and storm or
starve it into surrender. Another party, however, whose
secret sympathies were with the besieged, argued that whatever
material, wood or stone, was used for the construction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298">298</a></span>
of the dam would be either swallowed up in the depths of
the river or swept away by its current; and they drew such
a dismal picture of the hopelessness of the undertaking that
Stephen gave it up, and with it all attempt at a siege of
Bristol. Turning southward, he struck across the Mendip
hills into the heart of Somerset, and besieged William Lovel
in Castle Cary,<a id="Anchor_776" href="#Footnote_776" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 776.">[776]</a> a fortress whose remains, in the shape of
three grass-covered mounds, still overlook a little valley
where the river Cary takes its rise at the foot of the Polden
hills. According to one account, the place yielded to
Stephen;<a id="Anchor_777" href="#Footnote_777" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 777.">[777]</a> according to another,<a id="Anchor_778" href="#Footnote_778" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 778.">[778]</a> he built over against it
a tower in which he left a detachment of soldiers to
annoy its garrison, and marched northward to another
castle, Harptree, whose site is now buried in the middle
of a lonely wood. Harptree was gained by a stratagem
somewhat later on;<a id="Anchor_779" href="#Footnote_779" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 779.">[779]</a> for the present Stephen left it to
be harassed by the garrison of Bath, and pursued his
northward march to Dudley. Here he made no attempt
upon the castle, held against him by Ralf Paganel, but
contented himself with burning and harrying the neighbourhood,
and then led his host up the Severn to Shrewsbury.<a id="Anchor_780" href="#Footnote_780" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 780.">[780]</a>
The old “town in the scrub,” or bush, as its first
English conquerors had called it, had grown under the
care of its first Norman earl, Roger of Montgomery, into
one of the chief strongholds of the Welsh border. The
lands attached to the earldom, forfeited by the treason of
Robert of Bellême, had been granted by Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> to his
second queen, Adeliza; she and her second husband, William
of Aubigny, had now thrown themselves into the party of
her stepdaughter the Empress; and the castle built by Earl
Roger on the neck of a peninsula in the Severn upon which
the town of Shrewsbury stands was held in Matilda’s interest
by William Fitz-Alan, who had married a niece of Robert
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299">299</a></span>of Gloucester.<a id="Anchor_781" href="#Footnote_781" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 781.">[781]</a> William himself, with his wife and children,
slipped out at the king’s approach, leaving the garrison
sworn never to surrender. Stephen, however, caused the
fosse to be filled with wood, set it on fire, and literally
smoked them out.<a id="Anchor_782" href="#Footnote_782" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 782.">[782]</a> The noblest were hanged; the rest
escaped as best they could,<a id="Anchor_783" href="#Footnote_783" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 783.">[783]</a> while Stephen followed up his
success by taking a neighbouring castle which belonged to
Fitz-Alan’s uncle Arnulf of Hesdin, and hanging Arnulf
himself with ninety-three of his comrades.<a id="Anchor_784" href="#Footnote_784" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 784.">[784]</a> This unwonted
severity acted as a salutary warning which took effect at the
opposite end of the kingdom. Queen Matilda, with a
squadron of ships manned by sailors from her own county
of Boulogne, was blockading Walkelyn Maminot in Dover,
when the tidings of her husband’s victories in Shropshire
induced Walkelyn to surrender.<a id="Anchor_785" href="#Footnote_785" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 785.">[785]</a> This was in August.<a id="Anchor_786" href="#Footnote_786" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 786.">[786]</a>
When a truce had been patched up with Ralf Paganel,<a id="Anchor_787" href="#Footnote_787" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 787.">[787]</a> the
west of England might be considered fairly pacified, and
Stephen was free to march into Dorsetshire against Earl
Robert’s southernmost fortress, Wareham.<a id="Anchor_788" href="#Footnote_788" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 788.">[788]</a> Nothing, however,
seems to have come of this expedition; and Robert
himself was still out of reach beyond sea. In the midland
shires William Peverel, the lord of the Peak country,
was still unsubdued, but he was now almost isolated, for in
the north Eustace Fitz-John, as we have seen, had drawn
his punishment upon himself from other hands than those of
the king. Stephen’s successes in the west, his wife’s success
at Dover, were quickly followed by tidings of the victory at
Cowton Moor; and meanwhile a peacemaker had come upon
the scene.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1138 a schism which had rent the
Western Church asunder for seven years was ended by the
death of the anti-pope Anacletus, and Pope Innocent <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>
profited by the occasion to send Alberic bishop of Ostia as
legate into England—Archbishop William of Canterbury,
who had held a legatine commission together with the primacy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300">300</a></span>,
having died in November 1136.<a id="Anchor_789" href="#Footnote_789" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 789.">[789]</a> Alberic landed just
as the revolt broke out, and Stephen had therefore no choice
but to accept his credentials and let him pursue his mission,
whatever it might be.<a id="Anchor_790" href="#Footnote_790" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 790.">[790]</a> It proved to be wholly a mission of
peace. Alberic made a visitation-tour throughout England,<a id="Anchor_791" href="#Footnote_791" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 791.">[791]</a>
ending with a council at Carlisle, whither the king of Scots,
who had adhered to Anacletus, now came to welcome
Innocent’s representative. There, on the neutral ground of
young Henry’s English fief, the legate made an attempt to
mediate between David and Stephen; but all that the
former would grant was a truce until Martinmas, and a
promise to bring to Carlisle and there set free all the captive
Englishwomen who could be collected before that time, as
well as to enforce more Christian-like behaviour among his
soldiers for the future.<a id="Anchor_792" href="#Footnote_792" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 792.">[792]</a> On the third Sunday in Advent
the legate held a council at Westminster, when Theobald,
abbot of Bec, was elected archbishop of Canterbury by the
prior of Christ Church and certain delegates of the convent,
in presence of the king and the legate.<a id="Anchor_793" href="#Footnote_793" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 793.">[793]</a> Theobald’s consecration,
two days after Epiphany, brought Alberic’s mission
to a satisfactory close.<a id="Anchor_794" href="#Footnote_794" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 794.">[794]</a></p>

<p>In the work of mediation he had soon found that there
was one who had the matter more nearly at heart, and who
had a much better chance of success than himself. Queen
Matilda was warmly attached to her Scottish relatives, and
lost no opportunity of urging her husband to reconciliation
with them. At last, on April 9, she and her cousin
Henry met at Durham; David and Henry gave hostages
for their pacific conduct in the future, and the English
earldom of Northumberland was granted to Henry.<a id="Anchor_795" href="#Footnote_795" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 795.">[795]</a> The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301">301</a></span>
treaty was ratified by Stephen at Nottingham;<a id="Anchor_796" href="#Footnote_796" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 796.">[796]</a> the Scottish
prince stayed to keep Easter with his cousins, and afterwards
accompanied the king in an expedition against Ludlow.
The castle of Ludlow, founded probably by Roger de Lacy
in the reign of William Rufus, was destined in after-days to
become a treasure-house alike for historian, antiquary and
artist. Memories of every period in English history from the
twelfth century to the seventeenth throng the mighty pile,
in which almost every phase of English architecture may be
studied amid surroundings of the most exquisite natural
beauty. The site of the fortress, on a rocky promontory
rising more than a hundred feet above the junction of the
Corve and the Teme, was admirably adapted for defence.
The northern and western walls of its outer ward rose
abruptly from the steep slope of the rock itself; on the east
and south it was protected by a ditch, crossed by a bridge
which led to the inner ward and the keep, securely placed
near the south-western angle of the enclosure.<a id="Anchor_797" href="#Footnote_797" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 797.">[797]</a> The fief of
Ludlow had escheated to the Crown soon after Stephen’s
accession,<a id="Anchor_798" href="#Footnote_798" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 798.">[798]</a> and he had apparently bestowed it upon one
Joce or Joceas of Dinan,<a id="Anchor_799" href="#Footnote_799" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 799.">[799]</a> who now, it seems, was holding it
against him. The siege came to nothing, though it was
made memorable by an incident which nearly cost the life
of Henry of Scotland and furnished occasion for a characteristic<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302">302</a></span>
display of Stephen’s personal bravery. A grappling-iron
thrown from over the wall caught the Scottish prince,
dragged him off his horse, and had all but lifted him into
the castle, when the king rushed forward and set him free.<a id="Anchor_800" href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 800.">[800]</a>
This adventure, however, seems to have cooled Stephen’s
ardour for the assault, and after setting up two towers to
hold the garrison in check, he again withdrew to London.<a id="Anchor_801" href="#Footnote_801" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 801.">[801]</a>
Early in the year he had taken Earl Robert’s castle of
Leeds;<a id="Anchor_802" href="#Footnote_802" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 802.">[802]</a> and altogether his prospects were beginning to
brighten, when they were suddenly overclouded again by
his own rashness and folly.</p>

This is Joceas’s surname according to the romantic
    <cite><i>History of Fulk Fitzwarine</i></cite>,
and it is adopted by Mr. Eyton, who takes it as derived from Dinan in
Britanny; see his account of Joceas,
    <cite><i><abbr title="Antiquities of Shropshire">Antiqu. Shropsh.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 5">vol. v.</abbr> <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 244–247</cite>.
According to this, the name of <em>Dinham</em>, now borne by the part of Ludlow which
lies south and west of the castle, would be a corruption of <em>Dinan</em>, which the
above-mentioned romance (a work of the reign of Henry <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>) says was the name
given to the whole place in Joceas’s time. Mr. Wright, however
    (<cite><i>Hist. Ludlow</i>,
<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 13, 34</cite>), thinks that <em>Dinham</em> was the original name, afterwards superseded by
Ludlow; in which case Joceas becomes simply “Joceas of Dinham,” with a
surname derived not from a foreign birthplace, but from an English fief.

This is Leeds in Kent. It is probably through
mistaking it for its Yorkshire namesake that Henry was misled into his odd notion
that Stephen himself was fighting in the north, and compelled the Scots to a
pacification. See above, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 300, note 7<a href="#Footnote_800" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 800.">{800}</a>.

<p>The administrative machinery of the state was still in
the hands of Bishop Roger of Salisbury and the disciples
whom he had trained. Roger himself retained his office of
justiciar; the treasurership was held by his nephew, Nigel
bishop of Ely, and the chancellorship by one whom he also
called his nephew, but who was known to be really his son.
This latter was commonly distinguished as “Roger the
Poor”—a nickname pointed sarcastically at the enormous
wealth of the elder Roger, compared with which that of the
younger might pass for poverty. Outwardly, the justiciar
stood as high in Stephen’s favour as he had stood in
Henry’s; whatever he asked—and he was not slack in
asking—was granted at once: “I shall give him the half of
my kingdom some day, if he demands it!” was Stephen’s
own confession.<a id="Anchor_803" href="#Footnote_803" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 803.">[803]</a> But the greediness of the one and the
lavishness of the other sprang alike from a secret mistrust
which the mischief-makers of the court did their utmost to
foster. Stephen’s personal friends assured him that the
bishop of Salisbury and his nephews were in treasonable
correspondence with the Empress, that they were fortifying
and revictualling their castles in her behalf, and that the
worldly pomp and show, the vast retinue of armed followers,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303">303</a></span>
with which they were wont to appear at court, was really
intended for the support of her cause.<a id="Anchor_804" href="#Footnote_804" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 804.">[804]</a> How far the
suspicion was correct it is difficult to decide. Roger owed
his whole career to King Henry; he had broken his plighted
faith to Henry’s child; it is no wonder if his heart smote
him for the ungrateful deed. If, on the other hand, that
deed had been done from a real sense of duty to the state,
a sincere belief in the advantage of Stephen’s rule for
England, then it is no wonder if he felt that he had made a
grievous mistake, and sought to repair it by a return to his
earlier allegiance. But whatever may be thought of the
bishop’s conduct, nothing can justify that of the king. At
Midsummer 1139 Stephen summoned Bishop Roger to
come and speak with him at Oxford. Some foreboding of
evil—possibly some consciousness of double-dealing—made
the old man very unwilling to go;<a id="Anchor_805" href="#Footnote_805" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 805.">[805]</a> but he did go, and with
him went his son the chancellor, and his two nephews, the
treasurer and Alexander bishop of Lincoln,<a id="Anchor_806" href="#Footnote_806" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 806.">[806]</a> each accompanied
by a train of armed knights. Stephen, equally
suspicious, bade his men arm themselves likewise, to be
ready in case of need. While he was conversing with the
bishops in Oxford castle,<a id="Anchor_807" href="#Footnote_807" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 807.">[807]</a> a dispute about quarters arose
between their followers and those of the count of Meulan
and Alan of Richmond;<a id="Anchor_808" href="#Footnote_808" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 808.">[808]</a> a fray ensued, in which Alan’s
nephew was nearly killed,<a id="Anchor_809" href="#Footnote_809" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 809.">[809]</a> whereupon the two Rogers and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304">304</a></span>
the bishop of Lincoln were at once seized by the king.
Nigel of Ely, who was lodging apart from the others outside
the town,<a id="Anchor_810" href="#Footnote_810" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 810.">[810]</a> escaped, threw himself into his uncle’s castle of
Devizes, and prepared to stand a siege.<a id="Anchor_811" href="#Footnote_811" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 811.">[811]</a></p>

<p>The town of Devizes stands on a steep escarpment of
greensand penetrated by two deep ravines which give it the
form of a semicircle with a tongue projecting in the middle.
On this tongue of rocky ground, five hundred feet above the
level of the sea, the bishop of Salisbury had reared a castle
unsurpassed in strength and splendour by any fortress in
Europe.<a id="Anchor_812" href="#Footnote_812" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 812.">[812]</a> At its gates Stephen soon appeared, bringing the
two Rogers with him as captives. The elder he lodged in
a cowshed, the younger he threatened to hang if the place
was not surrendered at once. Its unhappy owner, in terror
for his son’s life, vowed neither to eat nor drink till the
castle was in the hands of Stephen;<a id="Anchor_813" href="#Footnote_813" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 813.">[813]</a> but neither his uncle’s
fasting nor his cousin’s danger moved Nigel to yield. The
keep, however, was held by the chancellor’s mother, Matilda
of Ramsbury, and the sight of a rope actually round her
son’s neck overcame her resistance. She offered her own
life in exchange for his, and the offer being refused, she
surrendered. Nigel could only follow her example.<a id="Anchor_814" href="#Footnote_814" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 814.">[814]</a> Roger’s
other castles, Sherborne and Malmesbury, soon fell likewise
into the king’s hands, and with them the enormous treasure
collected by their owner.<a id="Anchor_815" href="#Footnote_815" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 815.">[815]</a> Alexander of Lincoln was dragged
to the gates of Newark and there kept starving till he induced
his people to give up the place; and his other castle,
Sleaford, was gained by the same means.<a id="Anchor_816" href="#Footnote_816" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 816.">[816]</a></p>

<p>Such an outrage as Stephen had committed could not
pass unchallenged. His victims indeed were unpopular<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305">305</a></span>
enough; but two of them were bishops, and the whole English
Church was up in arms at once. And the English Church
was no longer without a fully qualified spokesman and leader.
That leader, however, was not the new-made primate. The
legatine commission held by William of Corbeil was not renewed
to his successor in the archbishopric: it was sent
instead to the man who had long been the most influential
member of the English episcopate—Henry, bishop of Winchester.
For nearly four months Henry kept this all-powerful
weapon lying idly in the scabbard;<a id="Anchor_817" href="#Footnote_817" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 817.">[817]</a> now, at the call of duty,
neither fear nor love hindered him from drawing it against
his own brother. Having vainly dinned into Stephen’s ears,
both privately and publicly, his entreaties for the restoration
of the two bishops, he fell back upon his legatine powers and
cited the king to answer for his conduct before a council at
Winchester on August 29.<a id="Anchor_818" href="#Footnote_818" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 818.">[818]</a></p>

<p>The council sat for three days, and the case was argued
out between Stephen’s advocate Aubrey de Vere, the bishop
of Salisbury and the legate. Henry formally charged his
brother with sacrilege, in having laid violent hands upon
bishops, and appropriated their lands and goods to his own
use. Stephen met the charge with the plea which had been
used by the Conqueror against Odo of Bayeux—he had
arrested the culprits not as bishops, but as unfaithful ministers
and disloyal subjects; and the property which he had
taken from them they had acquired as private men, in defiance
of the canons of the Church. Roger retorted that all
these accusations were false; both parties threatened an
appeal to Rome, and swords were drawn almost in the
council-chamber.<a id="Anchor_819" href="#Footnote_819" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 819.">[819]</a> The legate and the primate intervened
as peacemakers, and a compromise was arranged. It was
decreed by the council that all prelates who held fortresses
other than those which belonged to their sees should place
them under the king’s control, and confine themselves henceforth
to their canonical duties and rights.<a id="Anchor_820" href="#Footnote_820" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 820.">[820]</a> On the other<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306">306</a></span>
hand, Stephen’s act was solemnly condemned, and he had to
lay aside his royal robes and come as an humble penitent to
receive the censure of the Church.<a id="Anchor_821" href="#Footnote_821" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 821.">[821]</a> This humiliation saved
him from the ecclesiastical penalties of his misdeed; from
its political consequences nothing could save him now. He
had filled up the measure of his follies. When the obedience
of the barons had been forfeited—when the trust of the
people had been shaken—two forces still remained by whose
help he might have recovered all that he had lost: the
administration and the clergy. At a single blow he had
destroyed the one and thrown the other into opposition.</p>

<p>His rivals saw that the hour for which they were vainly
waiting in Normandy had struck at last in England. All
Geoffrey’s attempts on Normandy had failed. At the expiration
of his truce with Theobald of Blois in 1136 the
barons of Anjou were again in revolt,<a id="Anchor_822" href="#Footnote_822" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 822.">[822]</a> and it was not till
the end of September that Geoffrey was free to invade the
duchy. Its internal confusion was such that the twin earls
of Meulan and Leicester (sons of King Henry’s friend
Robert), who were trying to govern it for Stephen, had been
obliged again to call Count Theobald to their aid; but at
sight of the hated “Guirribecs,” as the Angevins were derisively
called, the Normans forgot their differences and rose
as one man against the common foe. On October 1 Geoffrey
was wounded in the right foot while besieging the castle of
Le Sap near Lisieux; that night his wife joined him with
reinforcements; but the morning had scarcely dawned when,
like another Geoffrey of Anjou ninety years earlier, he fled
with all his host<a id="Anchor_823" href="#Footnote_823" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 823.">[823]</a>—not, however, before the military fame of
the Norman duke, but before the vengeance of the Norman
people. Next spring he again ventured to attack the Hiesmois.<a id="Anchor_824" href="#Footnote_824" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 824.">[824]</a>
Stephen, who was now in Normandy and had just won its
investiture from King Louis, prepared to meet the invader;
but the jealousies between his Norman and his Flemish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307">307</a></span>
troops compelled him to abandon the attempt and make
another truce for two years.<a id="Anchor_825" href="#Footnote_825" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 825.">[825]</a> In April next the Angevins
broke the truce;<a id="Anchor_826" href="#Footnote_826" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 826.">[826]</a> in June Robert of Gloucester openly declared
for them, and under his influence Bayeux and Caen
surrendered to Geoffrey. The count of Anjou retired, however,
before a threatened attack from Stephen’s cousin Ralf
of Vermandois, in conjunction with Waleran of Meulan and
William of Ypres.<a id="Anchor_827" href="#Footnote_827" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 827.">[827]</a> Early in October he made an unsuccessful
attempt upon Falaise.<a id="Anchor_828" href="#Footnote_828" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 828.">[828]</a> In November he marched
upon Toucques, then one of the most flourishing seaport
towns of Normandy. The burghers were taken captive
“seated in their own arm-chairs,” and in their comfortable
houses the Angevins, after feasting to their heart’s content,
settled themselves carelessly for the night. But their presence
was known to William Trussebut, the governor of the
neighbouring castle of Bonneville; and at dead of night a
band of desperate characters, purposely chosen for a desperate
deed, came by his orders from Bonneville to Toucques, dispersed
silently throughout the town, and fired it in forty-five
places. The Angevins, wakened by the cries of the watchmen
and the roaring of the flames, fled headlong, leaving
their arms, horses and baggage behind them. William
Trussebut had come forth at the head of his men to intercept
their flight, but the smoke and the darkness were such
that neither party could distinguish friends from foes.
Geoffrey, bewildered as he was, managed to bring some of
his men to a stand in a cemetery; there the rest of the
Angevin force gradually collected, and waited, in shame and
trembling, for the day. At the first gleam of morning they
fled, and never stopped till they had buried themselves and
their disgrace safe within the walls of Argentan.<a id="Anchor_829" href="#Footnote_829" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 829.">[829]</a> This
time the Normans had taught Geoffrey a lesson which he
did not soon forget; he did not venture to meddle with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308">308</a></span>
them again for more than two years. Neither he nor his
wife made any movement at all till late in the following
summer, when a prospect was opened for them beyond the
sea by Stephen’s arrest of the two bishops. The council of
Winchester broke up on the first of September;<a id="Anchor_830" href="#Footnote_830" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 830.">[830]</a> on the
thirtieth the Empress was in England.</p>

<span class="ch3">1139–1147.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">On</span> the last day of September 1139 Matilda sailed in company
with her brother Robert and a hundred and forty
knights;<a id="Anchor_831" href="#Footnote_831" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 831.">[831]</a> they landed at Arundel, and were received into
the castle by its owner, the ex-queen Adeliza.<a id="Anchor_832" href="#Footnote_832" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 832.">[832]</a> Stephen
hurried to besiege them there, but before he could reach the
spot one of the travellers had left it. Earl Robert only
stayed to place his sister in safety beneath her step-mother’s
roof,<a id="Anchor_833" href="#Footnote_833" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 833.">[833]</a> and then set off to arouse her friends in England with
the tidings of her arrival. Stephen flew after him, but in
vain. With an escort of only twelve knights he rode right
across southern England, met Brian of Wallingford and told
him the news, carried it on to Miles at Gloucester, and got
safe to his journey’s end at Bristol.<a id="Anchor_834" href="#Footnote_834" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 834.">[834]</a> The baffled king threw
all his energies into the siege of Arundel, till his brother
joined him and suggested another scheme. Bishop Henry
argued that it was useless to besiege the Empress at one end
of England while her brother was stirring up the other, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310">310</a></span>
that it would be far wiser to get all the enemies collected in
one spot by letting her follow him to Bristol.<a id="Anchor_835" href="#Footnote_835" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 835.">[835]</a> That
Stephen, having once made up his mind to this course,
should not only give his rival a safe-conduct but should
commission the count of Meulan and the bishop of Winchester
himself to escort her till she reached her brother’s
care,<a id="Anchor_836" href="#Footnote_836" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 836.">[836]</a> was only what might have been expected from his
chivalrous character. Of the wisdom of the proceeding it is
difficult to judge. We can hardly imagine either of Stephen’s
predecessors giving a safe-conduct to a competitor for his
crown; but neither Rufus nor Henry had had to deal at once
with a lady-rival and with her brother; and both had been,
materially, politically and morally, in a much stronger position
than Stephen. As matters then stood with him, what in
itself looks like a piece of Quixotism may have been the best
means of cutting an awkward knot; and both he and Matilda
played their game so badly from beginning to end that it is
hardly worth while to criticize single moves on either side.</p>

never saw before or since. For want of a better name, we
call them the years of civil war and count them as part of
the reign of Stephen; but the struggle was not worthy of
the name of war, and the authority of the Crown, whether
vested in Stephen or in Matilda, was a mockery and a
shadow. The whole system of government established by
King Henry had fallen with his ministers; the death of
Bishop Roger in December 1139<a id="Anchor_837" href="#Footnote_837" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 837.">[837]</a> was typical of the
extinction of all law and order throughout the kingdom,
nearly half of which had already slipped from Stephen’s
grasp. While he kept his Christmas feast in Roger’s
episcopal city,<a id="Anchor_838" href="#Footnote_838" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 838.">[838]</a> Matilda was doing the like in regal state at
Gloucester, receiving homage from the western shires, and
distributing lands and honours at her will.<a id="Anchor_839" href="#Footnote_839" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 839.">[839]</a> Of the Easter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311">311</a></span>
assembly there is no notice at all,<a id="Anchor_840" href="#Footnote_840" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 840.">[840]</a> and by Whitsuntide
matters had reached such a pass that Stephen held his court
not at Westminster as usual but in the Tower, and only one
bishop, and that one a foreigner, could be got to attend it.<a id="Anchor_841" href="#Footnote_841" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 841.">[841]</a>
“In those days,” wrote one who lived through them, “there
was no king in the land, and every man did not only, as
once in Israel of old, that which was right in his own eyes,
but that which he knew and felt to be wrong.”<a id="Anchor_842" href="#Footnote_842" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 842.">[842]</a> For the
first and last time in English history, the feudal principle had
full play, uncontrolled by any check either from above or
from below, from regal supremacy or popular influence.
England was at the mercy of the body of feudal nobles
whose aim throughout the last seventy years had been to
break through the checks placed upon their action by the
Conqueror and his sons, and to master the power of the
Crown and the control of the state for their own private interests,
as the French feudataries had striven in an earlier
time to master the Crown of France. This was the condition
into which Normandy fell whenever its ducal coronet passed
to a weak man or a child, and from which it had had to be
forcibly rescued by almost every duke in succession, from
Richard the Fearless to Henry the First. By their sternly
repressive policy, by their careful adoption and dexterous use
of all those safeguards and checks upon the power of the
baronage which could be drawn from old English constitutional
practice, by their political alliance with the nation
against the disruptive tendencies of feudalism, and by their
strict administrative routine, the Conqueror and his sons had
hitherto managed to save England from such a catastrophe.
The break-down of their system under Stephen revealed its
radical defect: it rested, in the last resort, on a purely personal
foundation—on the strong hand of the king himself.
The “nineteen winters” that England <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312">312</a></span>“suffered for her sins”
under the nominal reign of Stephen were a time of discipline
which taught the people, the sovereign, and at last even the
barons themselves, to seek a wider and more lasting basis
for the organization and administration of the state. The
discipline was a very bitter one. The English chronicler’s
picture of it has been copied times out of number, yet whoever
would paint that terrible scene can but copy it once
again. “Every rich man made his castles and held them
against the king, and filled the land with castles. They
greatly oppressed the wretched men of the land with castle-work;
and when the castles were made, they filled them
with devils and evil men. They took the men who they
weened had any goods, both by night and by day, men and
women, and put them in prison for gold and silver, and
tortured them with unspeakable torture; never were martyrs
so tortured as they were<span class="dots">...</span>. When the wretched men had
no more to give, they reaved and burned all the townships;
and well thou mightest fare all a day’s journey and shouldst
never find a man sitting in a township, or land tilled. Corn
and cheese and butter were dear, for there was none in the
land. Wretched men starved of hunger; some went about
asking alms who once were rich men; some fled out of the
land. Never was more wretchedness in a land, and never
did heathen men worse than these did, for they forbore
neither for church nor churchyard, but took all the goods
that were therein and then burned church and all<span class="dots">...</span>. If
two or three men came riding to a township, all fled from
them, thinking they were reavers. The bishops and clerks
were ever cursing them; but that was nought to them; for
they were all accursed, and forsworn, and lost. Even if it
was tilled, the earth bare no corn, for it was all undone with
their deeds; and they said openly that Christ slept, and His
holy ones. Such things, and more than we can say, did we
thole nineteen winters for our sins.”<a id="Anchor_843" href="#Footnote_843" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 843.">[843]</a></p>

<p>The military history of the struggle is scarcely worth
following out in detail; for the most part it is but a dreary
tale of raid and counter-raid, of useless marches and unfinished
sieges, of towns and castles taken and retaken,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313">313</a></span>
plundered and burned, without any settled plan of campaign
on either side.<a id="Anchor_844" href="#Footnote_844" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 844.">[844]</a> By the close of the year 1140 the geographical
position of the two parties may be roughly marked
off by a line drawn from the Peak of Derbyshire to Wareham
on the Dorset coast. Owing to the influence of Robert
of Gloucester, Matilda was generally acknowledged throughout
the western shires; but she was almost imprisoned in
them, for the great highway of central England, the valley
of the Thames, from Oxford to the sea, was still in Stephen’s
hands; London was loyal to him, and so was Kent, although
the archbishop as yet stood aloof from both parties, as did
also the legate-bishop of Winchester and the bishops and
clergy in general. North of Thames, the midland shires
served as a wide battle-field where each of the combatants
in turn gained and lost ground, without any decisive advantage
on either side. In East-Anglia, Hugh Bigod was for
the moment again professing obedience to Stephen, but he
was simply watching the political tide to take it at the flood
and use it for his own interest; and so were the chief men
of central and northern England, the earls of Northampton,
Derby and York, the lords of the Peak, of Holderness and
of Richmond. In the north-west, between the Welsh march
and the southern border of Cumberland, lay a district ruled
by an almost independent chieftain whose action brought
about the first crisis in the war.</p>

<p>Of all the great nobles, the one whom both parties were
most anxious to win to their own interest was the earl of
Chester. His earldom was no empty title, no mushroom
creation of the last few years, but a great palatine jurisdiction
inherited in regular succession from Hugh of Avranches,
on whom it had been conferred by the Conqueror, and comprising
the sole government and ownership of the whole of
Cheshire. Within its limits the earl ruled supreme; every
acre of land, save what belonged to the Church, was held
under him; every man owed him suit and service; the king
himself had no direct authority within the little realm of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314">314</a></span>
Chester, and could claim from its sovereign nothing but the
homage due from vassal to overlord. The earl, in fact, as
has been often said, “held Chester by the sword as freely
as the king held England by the crown;” and as things
now stood the earl’s tenure was by far the more secure of
the two. The present ruler of this miniature kingdom, Ralf
by name, had been married almost in his boyhood to a
daughter of Robert of Gloucester.<a id="Anchor_845" href="#Footnote_845" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 845.">[845]</a> All his father-in-law’s
persuasions, however, had as yet failed to draw him to
Matilda’s side. Stephen on the other hand was equally
alive to the importance of securing Ralf’s adherence, and
lavished upon him all the honours he could desire,<a id="Anchor_846" href="#Footnote_846" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 846.">[846]</a> with one
exception. That one was the earldom of Carlisle, which
his father had held for a few years and then surrendered in
exchange for that of his cousin Richard of Chester, who
perished in the White Ship.<a id="Anchor_847" href="#Footnote_847" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 847.">[847]</a> Ralf accordingly quarrelled
for the possession of Carlisle with Henry of Scotland, of
whose Cumbrian earldom it now formed a part. Henry
appealed to Stephen, who could not but take his side,<a id="Anchor_848" href="#Footnote_848" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 848.">[848]</a> yet
for his own sake was anxious to satisfy Ralf. The mother
of Ralf and of his elder half-brother William of Roumare
was a great Lincolnshire heiress, daughter of Ivo Taillebois
by his marriage with a lady of Old-English race whose
family held considerable estates in that county, of which one
of them had been sheriff under the Conqueror.<a id="Anchor_849" href="#Footnote_849" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 849.">[849]</a> In consequence,
no doubt, of this old connexion, Stephen at the
close of the year 1140 contrived a meeting with the two
brothers somewhere in Lincolnshire, and there bestowed
great honour upon them both,<a id="Anchor_850" href="#Footnote_850" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 850.">[850]</a> including, as it seems, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315">315</a></span>
grant of the earldom of Lincoln to William of Roumare.<a id="Anchor_851" href="#Footnote_851" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 851.">[851]</a>
A mere empty title, however, satisfied neither of the brother-earls.
Rather, as the English chronicler says of them and
of all the rest, “the more he gave them the worse they
were to him.”<a id="Anchor_852" href="#Footnote_852" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 852.">[852]</a> His back was no sooner turned than they
planned a trick, which their wives helped them to execute,
for gaining possession of Lincoln castle.<a id="Anchor_853" href="#Footnote_853" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 853.">[853]</a> There Ralf set
himself up as lord and master of the city and the neighbourhood;<a id="Anchor_854" href="#Footnote_854" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 854.">[854]</a>
and we can want no more speaking witness to
the character of such feudal tyranny as was represented
in his person than the fact that not only the citizens, but
Stephen’s late victim Bishop Alexander himself, sent the
king an urgent appeal to come and deliver them from the
intruder.<a id="Anchor_855" href="#Footnote_855" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 855.">[855]</a></p>

<p>The news reached Stephen as he was keeping Christmas
in London, and the peaceful gathering of the court changed
into the muster of an armed host which set off at once for
Lincoln, and, actively supported by the citizens and the
bishop, sat down to besiege the castle.<a id="Anchor_856" href="#Footnote_856" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 856.">[856]</a> The present polygonal
keep of Lincoln castle appears to have been built by
Ralf of Chester in the last years of Stephen’s reign. That
which he now occupied stood on the same spot, on the south
side of the enclosure, and was the original round shell built
by the Conqueror upon a mound of still earlier date. Its
base was surrounded by ditches, the outer fortifications on
that side being on a lower level, and probably still consisting
of nothing more than the old English rampart-mound and
palisade; the other three sides of the enclosure, where there
was no such steep natural incline, were protected by a
curtain-wall raised upon the old mounds, and encircled by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316">316</a></span>
ditches wide and deep, but dry, for there was no means of
contriving a moat on the top of that limestone crag. The
brother-earls were not prepared for Stephen’s prompt and
vigorous attack: their force was small, and they had their
wives and children to protect. Ralf slipped out alone,<a id="Anchor_857" href="#Footnote_857" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 857.">[857]</a> made
his way to Chester to raise his followers there, and sent a
message to his father-in-law offering his allegiance to the
Empress if Robert would help the besieged at Lincoln out
of their strait.<a id="Anchor_858" href="#Footnote_858" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 858.">[858]</a> Even had his own daughter not been
among them, Earl Robert was not the man to miss such
a chance. At the head of the entire force of his party he
answered Ralf’s appeal; but so keenly did he feel the
importance of the crisis that he kept the real object
of his expedition a secret from all but his own nearest
friends; and the bulk of his host followed him all the
way from Gloucester without any idea whither he was
leading them, till they found themselves actually in sight of
the foe.<a id="Anchor_859" href="#Footnote_859" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 859.">[859]</a></p>

<p>The two earls probably met at Claybrook in Leicestershire.
At that point Ralf, coming down from Chester by
the Watling Street, and Robert, marching up by a branch
road from Gloucester, would both strike into the Foss-Way,
and thence would follow its north-eastward course along the
eastern side of the Trent valley. Between the road, the
river and the promontory of Lincoln stretched a tract of
low-lying marshy ground across which the Foss-Dyke ran
from the Trent at Torksey into the Witham just above the
bridge of Lincoln, thus connecting the two rivers and forming
an outlet for the superfluous waters of the Trent, which
in rainy seasons was only too apt, as it is even now, to
overflow its banks and flood all the surrounding country.
Against the storms of the winter of 1140 all precautions
had failed; the surging stream had risen far above the level
of the dyke, and the greater part of the ground between it
and the south-western slope of the Lincoln hill was drowned
in one vast sheet of water. The Foss-Way entered the city<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317">317</a></span>
by a bridge over the Witham; the two earls, however, could
not venture to take this route, and made instead for an
ancient ford which crossed the river a little farther westward,
nearer to its junction with the Foss-Dyke. Stephen was
evidently expecting them and had anticipated their course,
for he had posted a detachment of troops to guard the site
of this ford.<a id="Anchor_860" href="#Footnote_860" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 860.">[860]</a> All trace of the ford itself, however, was lost
in the flood. “Even so would I have it,” cried the earl of
Gloucester to his son-in-law, as in the dawn of Candlemas-day
they reached the southern margin of the water; “once
across, retreat will be impossible; we must conquer or die.”
The two leaders plunged in, swam boldly across the fordless
stream, and their whole host followed their example.<a id="Anchor_861" href="#Footnote_861" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 861.">[861]</a>
Stephen’s outpost fled or was overcome, and the earls
apparently wound their way round the foot of the hill till
they reached a tract of comparatively high and dry ground
on its south-western side. On the eastern border of this
tract, close under shelter of the ridge, a dark moving shadow
might tell them that swift and secret as their march had
been, Stephen was aware of it and had drawn out all his
forces to meet them;<a id="Anchor_862" href="#Footnote_862" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 862.">[862]</a> while on the height above there
loomed out dimly, through the chill grey mist of the
February morning, the outlines of the fortress which they
had come to deliver.</p>

<p>As they drew up in battle array on the marshy meadows
there arose a momentary dispute for precedence. The fiery
young earl of Chester pleaded that as the quarrel was his,
so the foremost place of danger and of honour should be
his likewise. But the quarrel was no longer Ralf’s alone.
The flower of the army which had come to aid him consisted
of the “Disinherited,” the men whom Stephen had deprived
of their lands and honours to bestow them on his own
favourites—the men whom Henry had raised up and whom
Stephen had cast down<a id="Anchor_863" href="#Footnote_863" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 863.">[863]</a>—and for them Earl Robert claimed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318">318</a></span>
the right of striking the first blow to avenge at once their
own wrongs and those of King Henry’s heiress. While his
eloquence was winding up their feelings to the highest
pitch of excitement,<a id="Anchor_864" href="#Footnote_864" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 864.">[864]</a> all was astir in the royal camp. There,
too, crown and kingdom were felt to be at stake, and many
of Stephen’s friends besought him not to risk everything in
a pitched battle till he should have gathered a larger force—above
all, not on that holy day, for it was Sexagesima
Sunday as well as the feast of the Purification.<a id="Anchor_865" href="#Footnote_865" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 865.">[865]</a> Sinister
omens at the early mass—the breaking of the lighted taper
in the king’s hand, the falling of the pyx upon the altar<a id="Anchor_866" href="#Footnote_866" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 866.">[866]</a>—lent
additional force to their entreaties; but Stephen was
impatient for the crisis and would hear of no delay.<a id="Anchor_867" href="#Footnote_867" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 867.">[867]</a> He
drew up his host in three divisions; two on horseback,
commanded respectively by Alan of Richmond and William
of Ypres;<a id="Anchor_868" href="#Footnote_868" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 868.">[868]</a> the third on foot around the royal standard,
with the king himself in their midst.<a id="Anchor_869" href="#Footnote_869" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 869.">[869]</a> In the opposing
army the van was taken by the “Disinherited”; the men of
Chester, who had first occupied it, now stood in the second
line, under the command of their own earl, and on foot.<a id="Anchor_870" href="#Footnote_870" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 870.">[870]</a>
The third line was headed by Robert of Gloucester, and on
the wings of the host was a crowd of half-savage Welshmen,
drawn from the Welsh dependencies of the earldoms of
Gloucester and Chester, and “better furnished with daring
than with arms.”<a id="Anchor_871" href="#Footnote_871" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 871.">[871]</a></p>

<p>In the midst of a spirited harangue addressed to the
royal troops by Baldwin of Clare—for among all Stephen’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_319">319</a></span>
popular gifts, that of eloquence was lacking<a id="Anchor_872" href="#Footnote_872" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 872.">[872]</a>—Earl Robert
sounded his trumpets for the attack. The Disinherited
charged the first line of the royal cavalry under the earls of
Richmond, Meulan, Norfolk, Northampton and Surrey, with
such vigour that it was scattered almost in a moment.
The second line of Stephen’s cavalry—the Flemings under
William of Ypres and the count of Aumale—were attacked
in flank by the Welsh, whom they put to flight, but a charge
of the men of Chester dispersed them in their turn, and the
whole body of horsemen on the king’s side turned tail at
once.<a id="Anchor_873" href="#Footnote_873" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 873.">[873]</a> Even William of Ypres for once forsook his royal
friend; and the hasty flight of the other leaders, with Alan
of Richmond at their head, shewed how half-hearted was
their attachment to the king.<a id="Anchor_874" href="#Footnote_874" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 874.">[874]</a> Stephen and his foot-soldiers
were left alone in the midst of the foe, who closed round
them on all sides and set to work to assault them as if
besieging a fortress. Again and again the horsemen dashed
upon that living wall, each time leaving a ghastly breach,
but each time driven back from the central point<a id="Anchor_875" href="#Footnote_875" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 875.">[875]</a> where the
king stood like a lion at bay,<a id="Anchor_876" href="#Footnote_876" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 876.">[876]</a> cutting down every one who
came within reach of his sword. The sword broke; but a
citizen of Lincoln who stood at his side replaced it by a
yet more terrible weapon—one of those two-handed Danish
battle-axes which it seems had not yet gone quite out of
use in the Danelaw.<a id="Anchor_877" href="#Footnote_877" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 877.">[877]</a> Almost all his followers were taken
or slain, yet still he fought on, with the rage of a wild<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_320">320</a></span>
beast<a id="Anchor_878" href="#Footnote_878" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 878.">[878]</a> and the courage of a hero, alone against an army. At
last Chester charged with all his forces straight at the king.
Down upon his helmet came the axe, and Ralf, on his knees
in the mire, learned that he was even yet no match for his
deserted and outraged sovereign.<a id="Anchor_879" href="#Footnote_879" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 879.">[879]</a> Most likely it was that
blow, dealt at the traitor with all Stephen’s remaining
strength, which broke the axe in his hands.<a id="Anchor_880" href="#Footnote_880" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 880.">[880]</a> Then a stone,
hurled no one knew whence, struck him on the head and he
fell.<a id="Anchor_881" href="#Footnote_881" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 881.">[881]</a> A knight, William of Kahaines, seized him by the
helmet, shouting “Hither, hither! I have the king!”<a id="Anchor_882" href="#Footnote_882" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 882.">[882]</a>
Yet even then Stephen shook him off, and it was only to
Robert of Gloucester in person that he deigned to surrender
at last.<a id="Anchor_883" href="#Footnote_883" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 883.">[883]</a> Baldwin of Clare and three other faithful
ones were captured with him; all the rest of the gallant
little band were already taken or slain.<a id="Anchor_884" href="#Footnote_884" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 884.">[884]</a> The triumphant
host marched into Lincoln and sacked the town under the
royal captive’s eyes.<a id="Anchor_885" href="#Footnote_885" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 885.">[885]</a> He was then conveyed to Gloucester
and there presented, as a great prize, by Earl Robert to
his sister, who straightway sent him to prison in Bristol
castle.<a id="Anchor_886" href="#Footnote_886" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 886.">[886]</a></p>

<p>Matilda’s day had come now. Within three weeks after
the battle of Lincoln one of her adherents, Miles Beauchamp,
regained Bedford castle from its titular earl Hugh the Poor;<a id="Anchor_887" href="#Footnote_887" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 887.">[887]</a>
William Peverel was forced to surrender Nottingham;<a id="Anchor_888" href="#Footnote_888" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 888.">[888]</a> Hervey<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_321">321</a></span>
of Lions, Stephen’s son-in-law, was driven out of Devizes;<a id="Anchor_889" href="#Footnote_889" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 889.">[889]</a>
and Alan of Richmond, repenting of his treason and vainly
striving to atone for it, was caught in a trap which he himself
had laid for Ralf of Chester, flung into a dungeon, and
compelled to make submission to the earl and the Empress
both at once;<a id="Anchor_890" href="#Footnote_890" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 890.">[890]</a> while voluntary offers of service and homage
came flowing in to Gloucester from all quarters.<a id="Anchor_891" href="#Footnote_891" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 891.">[891]</a> Still the
clergy held aloof. The outrage of Midsummer 1139 had
made it impossible for them to support the king; but he
was still the Lord’s anointed, to whom their faith was
pledged; and their leader, Henry of Winchester, was his
own brother. Matilda, anxious above all things to gain
Henry’s adhesion, bluntly sent him word that if he would
join her, she would honour him as the chief among her
counsellors; if not, she would lead “all the armies of England”
against him at once. The legate, thus driven into a
corner—for, at the moment, her words were by no means an
empty threat—felt that even for his brother’s interest, let
alone the interest of the Church, which was really dearer to
him than all beside, his best course was to make terms with
the victorious party.<a id="Anchor_892" href="#Footnote_892" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 892.">[892]</a> The terms were arranged between
him and his imperial cousin in person, on a rainy March
morning in the plain before Winchester. Next day the old

forth how, as vicar of the Apostolic see, he had summoned
this assembly to consider of the best means of restoring order
in the land; he contrasted its present wretched state with
the good peace which it had enjoyed under King Henry; he
recited how the crown had been promised to Matilda;—how,
in consequence of her absence at her father’s death, it had
seemed wiser to secure a king at once in the person of
Stephen;—how he, the speaker, had stood surety for the
maintenance of the new king’s promises to the Church and
the nation<span class="nobreak">:—</span>and how shamefully those promises had been
broken. He had tried to bring his brother to reason, but in
vain; and now the matter had been decided by a higher

Stephen into the hand of his rival, and cast him down from
his throne; the speaker’s duty was to see that throne filled

with the bishops and clergy to whom the right of election
chiefly belonged; their choice had fallen upon the candidate
to whom their faith had been plighted long ago; he called<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323">323</a></span>

<p>Not a dissentient voice was raised save that of a clerk
of the queen’s household, who ventured to read out a letter
from his mistress to the legate, passionately entreating for
her husband’s restoration. The deputation from London,
who seem to have been the only laymen in the assembly,
did not exactly oppose the decision of the majority; they
merely pleaded for Stephen’s release, and carried back a
report of the proceedings to their fellow-citizens, with a view
to gaining their assent. It was not till just before midsummer
that the Londoners were finally persuaded to
forsake their own chosen king;<a id="Anchor_898" href="#Footnote_898" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 898.">[898]</a> then, indeed, they opened
their gates with the utmost humility;<a id="Anchor_899" href="#Footnote_899" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 899.">[899]</a> and thus the Lady

<p>The triumph did not last long. Matilda fell, just as her
rival had fallen, by her own fault; only the faults of the two
cousins were of a directly opposite nature. The Lady’s
habitual temper was that of her grandfather the Conqueror—“very
stern to all who withstood her will”; and her will
was not, like his, kept under the control of sound policy and
reason. Where Stephen had erred through his fatal readiness
to listen to the most worthless counsellors, Matilda erred
through her obstinate refusal to listen to any counsellors at
all. She was no sooner in London than she began confiscating
lands and honours and disposing of Church property
more ruthlessly than ever Stephen had done; and neither
the brother to whom she owed her victory, nor the legate to
whom she owed her throne, nor the old king of Scots who
came to share his niece’s triumph and give her the benefit
of his mature wisdom, could succeed in bringing her to
reason. Not a word of conciliation would she hear from any
one. The queen appealed to her in behalf of her captive
husband; some of the great nobles did the like; but she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324">324</a></span>
was deaf to their prayers. The bishop of Winchester
besought her at least to secure to Stephen’s children the
possessions which he had held before he became king; but
she would not hear him either. The citizens of London besought
her to give them back “the Laws of King Eadward”;<a id="Anchor_901" href="#Footnote_901" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 901.">[901]</a>
and that, too, she refused. She did worse; she summoned
the richest burghers to her presence, demanded from them
instant payment of a large sum of money, and when they
respectfully remonstrated, drove them away with a torrent
of abuse, utterly refusing all abatement or delay.<a id="Anchor_902" href="#Footnote_902" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 902.">[902]</a> She was
soon punished. All through the spring Matilda of Boulogne
had been busy in Kent with the help of William of Ypres,
rallying her husband’s scattered partizans, and gathering an
army which she now led up, wasting, plundering, slaughtering
all before them, almost to the gates of London. Her
vigorous action determined that of the citizens. One day,
as the Empress was quietly sitting down to dinner, the bells
began to ring, the people came swarming out of their houses
“like bees out of a hive”; the whole city flew to arms; and
she and her friends were driven to flee, some one way, some
another, as fast as their horses could carry them.<a id="Anchor_903" href="#Footnote_903" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 903.">[903]</a> Earl
Robert accompanied his sister as far as Oxford;<a id="Anchor_904" href="#Footnote_904" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 904.">[904]</a> thence she
hurried on to Gloucester to consult with her favourite Miles,
the only person who seems to have had any real influence
over her, and brought him back with her to Oxford to help
in rallying her scattered forces.<a id="Anchor_905" href="#Footnote_905" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 905.">[905]</a> Her cousin the queen
meanwhile was in London at the head of an enthusiastic
city, eager for the restoration of Stephen; from one end of
England to the other the heroic wife was leaving no stone
unturned in her husband’s interest, and her zeal was speedily
rewarded by the re-conversion of the legate. Utterly disgusted
at the result of his second attempt at king-making
for the good of the Church, after one last warning to the
Empress he met his sister-in-law at Guildford, reversed all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325">325</a></span>
the excommunications issued against Stephen’s party by
the council of Winchester, and pledged himself to do
henceforth all that in him lay for the restoration of the
captive king.<a id="Anchor_906" href="#Footnote_906" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 906.">[906]</a> Robert of Gloucester vainly sought to win

for Winchester.<a id="Anchor_908" href="#Footnote_908" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 908.">[908]</a></p>

<p>Of the two royal dwelling-places founded at Winchester
by the Conqueror, only one now remained. He and his
sons apparently found the castle at the western end of the
city a more agreeable residence than the palace whose inconvenient
proximity drove the monks of the New Minster to
remove to Hyde. This palace was almost as great a nuisance
to the Old Minster as to the New, and three years after King
Henry’s death his nephew and namesake the bishop determined
to get rid of it. Amid the gathering storms of the
year 1138 Bishop Henry, in his turn, grew dissatisfied with
his episcopal abode hard by the cathedral church, and
resolved that he too would have a castle of his own. With
an audacity characteristic alike of the man and of the time,
he carried the stones of his grandfather’s deserted palace
down to a clear space within the “soke” or “liberty” of the
church, just within the eastern boundary of the city, and
there set them up again in the shape of a mighty fortress<a id="Anchor_909" href="#Footnote_909" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 909.">[909]</a>
afterwards known as Wolvesey-house, some fragments of
whose walls still stand, broken and overhung with ivy, in a
green enclosure between the river-bank and the long, dark
pile of the cathedral. As the Lady rode into Winchester
by one gate the bishop rode out by another, to shut himself
up in Wolvesey.<a id="Anchor_910" href="#Footnote_910" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 910.">[910]</a> Matilda established herself without<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326">326</a></span>
opposition in the castle,<a id="Anchor_911" href="#Footnote_911" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 911.">[911]</a> and thence sent him a civil message
requesting him to come and speak with her. He answered,
“I will make me ready”;<a id="Anchor_912" href="#Footnote_912" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 912.">[912]</a> and he did so, by despatching
an urgent summons to all the partizans of the king.<a id="Anchor_913" href="#Footnote_913" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 913.">[913]</a> The
Empress, too, called up her friends; they hurried to her
support, quartered themselves in the city with the goodwill
of the inhabitants, and beset both the bishop’s palace
and his fortress with all the troops they could muster.<a id="Anchor_914" href="#Footnote_914" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 914.">[914]</a>
But his summons was no less effectual than hers. It
brought up all the barons who still held with Stephen;
it brought up a troop of mercenaries;<a id="Anchor_915" href="#Footnote_915" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 915.">[915]</a> best of all, it
brought up, not only William of Ypres with his terrible
Flemings,<a id="Anchor_916" href="#Footnote_916" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 916.">[916]</a> but a thousand valiant citizens of London with
Stephen’s own Matilda at their head.<a id="Anchor_917" href="#Footnote_917" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 917.">[917]</a> The besiegers of
Wolvesey found themselves beset in their turn by “the
king’s queen with all her strength”;<a id="Anchor_918" href="#Footnote_918" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 918.">[918]</a> the bishop himself
ordered the town to be fired, and the wind, which saved
the cathedral, carried the flames northward as far as
Hyde abbey.<a id="Anchor_919" href="#Footnote_919" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 919.">[919]</a> While he thus made a desert for the
besiegers within the city, the queen was doing the like
without. Under her directions the London contingent
were guarding every approach from the west, whence alone
the Lady’s troops could look for supplies: the convoys were
intercepted, their escorts slain; and while eastward the roads
were lined all the way to London with parties bringing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_327">327</a></span>
provision for the bishop and his little garrison, his besiegers
already saw famine staring them in the face.<a id="Anchor_920" href="#Footnote_920" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 920.">[920]</a> At last
they sent out a body of knights, three hundred strong, to
Wherwell, intending there to build a castle as a cover for
their convoys.<a id="Anchor_921" href="#Footnote_921" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 921.">[921]</a> They had no sooner reached the spot than
William of Ypres pounced upon them and captured the
whole party.<a id="Anchor_922" href="#Footnote_922" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 922.">[922]</a></p>

<p>Then Robert of Gloucester felt that the case was hopeless,
and that, cost what it might, he must get his sister out.
Suddenly, as he was marshalling his host to cut their way
through at all risks,<a id="Anchor_923" href="#Footnote_923" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 923.">[923]</a> on the evening of September 13, the
city gates were opened, and peace was proclaimed in the
bishop’s name.<a id="Anchor_924" href="#Footnote_924" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 924.">[924]</a> Robert hereupon decided to march quietly
out next morning. He took, however, the precaution of
sending his sister out first of all, while he brought up the
rear with a small band of men as dauntless as himself.<a id="Anchor_925" href="#Footnote_925" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 925.">[925]</a> He
did wisely. Matilda had but just ridden through the west
gate when the bishop, doubtless from his tower at Wolvesey,
gave the signal for attack. The whole host of the queen’s
partizans rushed upon those of the Lady and routed them
completely. Earl Robert succeeded in covering his sister’s
retreat, and cut his own way out in another direction, but
was overtaken at Stockbridge by William of Ypres and his
Flemings, who surrounded and took him prisoner.<a id="Anchor_926" href="#Footnote_926" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 926.">[926]</a> Miles of
Gloucester (whom the Empress had made earl of Hereford),
surrounded in like manner, threw down his arms and fled for
his life, reaching Gloucester in disgrace, weary, alone, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328">328</a></span>
almost naked.<a id="Anchor_927" href="#Footnote_927" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 927.">[927]</a> King David, it is said, was thrice made
prisoner, but each time bribed his captors to let him go,<a id="Anchor_928" href="#Footnote_928" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 928.">[928]</a> and
was hidden in safety at last by a certain David Holcfard,
who happened to be his godson.<a id="Anchor_929" href="#Footnote_929" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 929.">[929]</a> The archbishop of Canterbury
and several other bishops who had accompanied the
Empress were despoiled of their horses and even of their
clothes. The Lady herself had escaped in company with
the Breton lord of Wallingford, Brian Fitz-Count, who had
long been her devoted friend and who never forsook her.<a id="Anchor_930" href="#Footnote_930" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 930.">[930]</a>
Their first halt was at Luggershall; urged by her friends,
still in terror of pursuit, she mounted another horse and
spurred on to Devizes; there, half dead with fatigue, she
laid herself on a bier, and bound to it with ropes as if she had
been a corpse, she was carried at last safe into Gloucester.</p>

He was, all his life, a most loyal and useful member of the Angevin party. His
father’s first wife was the Conqueror’s daughter Constance; the second was Fulk
Rechin’s daughter Hermengard; Brian, however, had no kindred with the house
which he served so well.

<p>Earl Robert was brought back to Winchester to the feet
of the queen, who sent him, under his captor’s charge, into
honourable confinement in Rochester castle.<a id="Anchor_931" href="#Footnote_931" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 931.">[931]</a> The next six
weeks were spent in negotiations for his release and that of
Stephen; for the party of the Empress found themselves
helpless without Robert, and the chief aim of Matilda of
Boulogne was to get her husband free. She proposed to
Countess Mabel of Gloucester—for the Empress held sullenly
aloof—that the two illustrious captives should simply
be exchanged, and to this Mabel eagerly assented. Robert,
however, protested that an earl was no equivalent for a king,
and insisted that all those who had been captured with him
should be thrown in to balance the crown. To this their
various captors naturally demurred, and the project failed.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329">329</a></span><a id="Anchor_932" href="#Footnote_932" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 932.">[932]</a>
It was next proposed to settle the whole dispute by restoring
Stephen to his throne and making Robert governor
of England in his name;<a id="Anchor_933" href="#Footnote_933" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 933.">[933]</a> but the earl would agree to nothing
without his sister’s consent, and the Empress refused to
modify her claims in any way.<a id="Anchor_934" href="#Footnote_934" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 934.">[934]</a> The queen threatened that
if Robert did not yield, she would send him over to Boulogne
and keep him there in chains for the rest of his life; but he
knew that if a hair of his head was touched his countess,
whom he had left in command at Bristol, would at once ship
off her royal captive to Ireland, and the threat produced no
effect. Meanwhile the party of the Empress was falling
to pieces so rapidly that her few genuine adherents grew
alarmed for her personal safety, and besought Robert to
accept freedom on any terms, as the sole chance of averting
her ruin. The original proposition of a simple exchange
was therefore revived, and accepted in the first days of
November.<a id="Anchor_935" href="#Footnote_935" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 935.">[935]</a></p>

<p>The earl rejoined his sister at Oxford;<a id="Anchor_936" href="#Footnote_936" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 936.">[936]</a> the king re-entered
his capital amid general rejoicings.<a id="Anchor_937" href="#Footnote_937" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 937.">[937]</a> His misfortunes,
the heroism of his queen, the overbearing conduct of the
Empress, all helped to turn the tide of popular feeling in his
favour once more. Early in December the legate, with such
daring indifference to the awkwardness of his own position
as can surely have been due to nothing but conscious integrity
of purpose, called a council at Westminster and formally
undid the work which he had done at Winchester in the
spring. After a solemn complaint had been lodged by
Stephen against the vassals who had betrayed and captured
him—the counterpart of the charge once made in a similar
assembly against Stephen himself, of having been false to
his duty as king—Henry rose and made his apology. He
had acquiesced in the rule of the Empress, believing it a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330">330</a></span>
necessary evil; the evil had proved intolerable, and he was
thankful to be delivered from its necessity. In the name of
Heaven and its Roman representative he therefore once more
proclaimed his brother as the lawfully-elected and apostolically-anointed
sovereign to whom obedience was due, and
denounced as excommunicate all who upheld the claims of
the Angevin countess. The clergy sat in puzzled silence;
but their very silence gave consent.<a id="Anchor_938" href="#Footnote_938" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 938.">[938]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Throughout the winter both parties remained quiet,
Stephen in London, Matilda in Oxford; both, in the present
exhausted state of their forces, had enough to do in simply
standing their ground, without risking any attack upon each
other. In the spring Matilda removed to Devizes; there,
at Mid-Lent, she held with her partizans a secret council
which resulted in an embassy to Anjou, calling upon
Geoffrey to come and help in regaining the English heritage
of his wife and son. At Pentecost the answer came. Geoffrey,
before he would accede to the summons, required to be
certified of its reasonableness, and he would accept no
assurance save that of the earl of Gloucester in person.
Robert, knowing how closely his sister’s interest and even
her personal safety was bound up with his presence at her
side, was very unwilling to undertake the mission. A scheme
was however contrived to satisfy him. Matilda returned
to her old quarters at Oxford; the chief men of her party
bound themselves by oath to keep within a certain distance
of the city, and to guard her against all danger until her
brother’s return. On this understanding he sailed from
Wareham shortly before Midsummer. He was but just
gone when Stephen, who since Easter had been lying sick
at Northampton, swooped down upon Wareham so suddenly
that the garrison, taken by surprise, yielded to him at once.<a id="Anchor_939" href="#Footnote_939" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 939.">[939]</a>
The king marched up to Cirencester, surprised and destroyed
a castle lately built there by the Empress,<a id="Anchor_940" href="#Footnote_940" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 940.">[940]</a> and thence
turned westward to try conclusions with Matilda herself by
attacking her headquarters at Oxford.</p>

<p>Oxford was, from its geographical situation, one of the
most important strategical posts in England. It stood at
the very centre and crowning-point of the valley of the
Thames, the great high-way which led from the eastern
sea and the capital into the western shires, through the very
heart of the land. So long as it remained loyal to Stephen,
he was master of the whole Thames valley, and the Angevins,
however complete might be their triumph in the
west, were cut off from all direct communication with
eastern England and even with the capital itself. The
surrender of Oxford castle to Matilda in the summer of
1141 had reversed this position of affairs. It probably
helped to determine—it was at any rate soon followed by—the
surrender of London; and even when London was again
lost to the Empress, her possession of Oxford still gave her
command over the upper part of the river-valley and thus
secured her main line of communication with her brother’s
territories in the west, while Stephen in his turn was almost
prisoned in the eastern half of his realm. For nearly eleven
months he had seen her defying him from her father’s palace
of Beaumont or from the impregnable stronghold of the
castle, where the first Robert of Oilly, not content with raising
a shell-keep on the old English mound, had built another
tall square tower which still stands, on the western side of
the enclosure, directly above the river.<a id="Anchor_941" href="#Footnote_941" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 941.">[941]</a> Not until her
brother had left her did the king venture to take up the
challenge which her very presence there implied; then indeed
he felt that the hour had come. Matilda, as if in
expectation of his attack, had been employing her followers
on the construction of a chain of forts intended to protect
and keep open her communications with the west.<a id="Anchor_942" href="#Footnote_942" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 942.">[942]</a> One by
one Stephen broke the links of the chain—Cirencester,
Bampton, Ratcot<a id="Anchor_943" href="#Footnote_943" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 943.">[943]</a>—and from this last place, a little village
in the midst of a marsh, half-way between Bampton and
Farringdon, he led his host across the Isis and round by the
meadows on its southern shore to the ford below <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Frideswide’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332">332</a></span>
from which the city took its name. Matilda’s partizans
no sooner discovered his approach—three days before
Michaelmas<a id="Anchor_944" href="#Footnote_944" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 944.">[944]</a>—than they streamed down to the bank of the
river, across which they greeted him first with a torrent of
abuse and then with a flight of arrows. The vanguard of
the royal host, with Stephen himself at their head, sprang
into the water, swam rather than waded across the well-known
and time-honoured ford,<a id="Anchor_945" href="#Footnote_945" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 945.">[945]</a> and by the fury of their
onset drove their insulting enemies back to the city gates.
The rest of the army quickly followed; Matilda’s adherents
fled through the open gate, their pursuers rushed in after
them, entered the town without difficulty, set it on fire,
captured and slew all on whom they could lay their hands,
and drove the rest to take shelter in the castle with their
Lady.<a id="Anchor_946" href="#Footnote_946" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 946.">[946]</a></p>

<p>Stephen had doubtless not braved <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Frideswide’s wrath
by entering Oxford, so to say, under her very eyes. His
troops had won the city; his task was to win the castle,
and that task he vowed never to abandon till both fortress
and Empress should be in his hands. For nearly three
months he blockaded the place, till its inhabitants were on
the verge of starvation. The barons who had sworn to
protect Matilda, bitterly ashamed of their failure, gathered
at Wallingford ready to meet Stephen if he should chance
to offer them battle; but he had no such intention, and
they dared not attack him where he was.<a id="Anchor_947" href="#Footnote_947" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 947.">[947]</a> At last a gleam
of hope came with Earl Robert’s return, quickened, it seems,
by tidings of his sister’s danger. Landing at Wareham with
a force of some three or four hundred Normans, he regained
the port and the village without difficulty, and as his force
was too small to effect Matilda’s relief directly, he laid siege
to the castle, hoping by this means to make a diversion in
her favour.<a id="Anchor_948" href="#Footnote_948" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 948.">[948]</a> The garrison of Wareham did in fact send
a message to Stephen beseeching him to come and relieve<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333">333</a></span>
them before a certain day, as if he did not, they must give
up the place.<a id="Anchor_949" href="#Footnote_949" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 949.">[949]</a> But the king was not to be drawn from his
prey; he left Wareham to its fate, and after a three weeks’
siege it surrendered. Robert went on to Portland and
Lulworth, took them both, and then summoned all the
friends of the Empress to meet him at Cirencester, thence to
set out with their united forces for the rescue of Matilda
herself.<a id="Anchor_950" href="#Footnote_950" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 950.">[950]</a> In Oxford castle the provisions were all but
exhausted; the Lady despaired of succour.<a id="Anchor_951" href="#Footnote_951" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 951.">[951]</a> Her faithful
friend the lord of the castle, Robert of Oilly, had died a
fortnight before the siege began.<a id="Anchor_952" href="#Footnote_952" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 952.">[952]</a> Christmas was close at
hand; the snow lay thick on the ground; the river was
frozen fast. From the top of D’Oilly’s tall tower nothing
was to be seen but one vast sheet of cold, dead white,
broken only by the dark masses of Stephen’s host encamped
round about upon the frozen meadows<span class="nobreak">:—</span>a dreary outlook,
but the prospect within was drearier still. Matilda had gone
through too many adventures to shrink from the risk of one
more. One night four white-robed figures<a id="Anchor_953" href="#Footnote_953" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 953.">[953]</a> dropped down
by a rope<a id="Anchor_954" href="#Footnote_954" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 954.">[954]</a> over the castle-wall upon the frozen river at its
foot; they crossed dry-shod over the stream whose waters, a
little lower down, had been almost over the heads of their
enemies three months before; their footsteps fell noiseless
upon the fresh snow, their white garments reflected its gleams
and deceived the eyes of Stephen’s sentinels; in the stillness
of the night, broken only by the bugle-call and the watchman’s
cry, they stole through the besieging lines and across
the very sleeping-quarters of the king—never caught, never
discovered save by one man in all the host; and he, whether
taking them for ghosts, or in chivalrous sympathy for their
desperate venture, let them pass unchallenged and kept his
story till the morrow.<a id="Anchor_955" href="#Footnote_955" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 955.">[955]</a> Five miles they fled on foot <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334">334</a></span>“over
snow and ice, over ditch and dale”; at Abingdon they
took horse, and before the morning broke the Empress
Matilda and her faithful comrades were safe under the
protection of Brian Fitz-Count in his great fortress of
Wallingford.<a id="Anchor_956" href="#Footnote_956" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 956.">[956]</a></p>

<p>At Wallingford her brother came to meet her, accompanied
not by her husband but by her son, a child nine
years old whom Geoffrey, now absorbed in the conquest of
Normandy, had sent to England in his stead.<a id="Anchor_957" href="#Footnote_957" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 957.">[957]</a> The escape
from Oxford was Matilda’s last exploit. The castle surrendered
to Stephen as soon as she had left it;<a id="Anchor_958" href="#Footnote_958" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 958.">[958]</a> she
returned to her old quarters at Bristol or Gloucester; and
thenceforth she ceased to figure prominently in the war
which dragged languidly on for five more years. A battle
between Stephen and Earl Robert near Wilton, on July 1st,
1143, in which the king was utterly routed and only
escaped being made prisoner a second time by taking to
headlong flight,<a id="Anchor_959" href="#Footnote_959" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 959.">[959]</a> was the last real success of the Angevin
party. The year closed with a severe blow to the Empress,
in the death of her trusted friend Miles of Hereford, who
was slain on Christmas Eve, not in fight, but by a chance
shot in hunting.<a id="Anchor_960" href="#Footnote_960" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 960.">[960]</a> Early in the next year Ralf of Chester
again seized Lincoln castle;<a id="Anchor_961" href="#Footnote_961" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 961.">[961]</a> but Ralf fought for his own
hand rather than for the Empress; and so, too, did Hugh
Bigod, Turgis of Avranches and Geoffrey of Mandeville,
who kept all eastern England in ceaseless commotion.<a id="Anchor_962" href="#Footnote_962" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 962.">[962]</a>
Stephen’s energies were absorbed in a vain endeavour to
reduce them to order, while Robert struggled almost as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335">335</a></span>
vainly against the anarchy of the western shires; in the
north Ralf of Chester now ruled supreme from the Witham
to the Dee; and the upper valley of the Thames was at the
mercy of William of Dover, who had built a castle at
Cricklade, from which he ravaged the whole country between
Oxford and Malmesbury.<a id="Anchor_963" href="#Footnote_963" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 963.">[963]</a></p>

<p>Suddenly, after capturing the commandant of Malmesbury
and sending him as a great prize to the Empress, the
lord of Cricklade threw aside his evil work and went off to
die for a nobler cause in Palestine.<a id="Anchor_964" href="#Footnote_964" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 964.">[964]</a> Geoffrey de Mandeville,
the worst of all the troublers of the land, who had
accepted titles and honours from both the rival sovereigns
and had never for one moment been true to either, met his
death in the same summer of 1144 in a skirmish with the
king’s troops; his fellow-sinner Robert of Marmion was
soon afterwards slain by the earl of Chester’s men at the
gates of the abbey of Bath which he had desecrated.<a id="Anchor_965" href="#Footnote_965" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 965.">[965]</a> For
a moment it seemed as if the cry which had long been
going up from all the desolated sanctuaries of England—“Up,
Lord, why sleepest Thou?”—had been heard and
answered at last.<a id="Anchor_966" href="#Footnote_966" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 966.">[966]</a> Philip of Gloucester, Earl Robert’s son,
who had taken William of Dover’s place at Cricklade, was
so hard pressed by the garrison of Oxford<a id="Anchor_967" href="#Footnote_967" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 967.">[967]</a> that he called
his father to his aid; Robert built a great castle at Farringdon,
but the king besieged it with such vigour that its
defenders were compelled to surrender.<a id="Anchor_968" href="#Footnote_968" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 968.">[968]</a> From that moment
the Angevin party fell rapidly to pieces. Young Philip of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336">336</a></span>
Gloucester himself went over to Stephen and turned his
arms against his own father.<a id="Anchor_969" href="#Footnote_969" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 969.">[969]</a> The earl of Chester came to
meet the king at Stamford,<a id="Anchor_970" href="#Footnote_970" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 970.">[970]</a> humbly apologized for his
rebellion, and sought to prove the sincerity of his repentance
by regaining Bedford for Stephen, by constantly accompanying
him with a band of three hundred picked knights,
and by helping him to build a fortress at Crowmarsh to
keep the garrison of Wallingford in check.<a id="Anchor_971" href="#Footnote_971" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 971.">[971]</a> As, however,
he still refused to give up the castles which he had seized
and to pay his dues to the royal treasury, he was naturally
regarded with suspicion by the other barons and by the
king himself.<a id="Anchor_972" href="#Footnote_972" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 972.">[972]</a> In the summer of 1146 their mutual distrust
came to a crisis at Northampton. Ralf besought
Stephen’s help against the Welsh; the barons persuaded
Stephen to let them answer in his name that he would not
give it unless Ralf surrendered his castles and gave hostages
for his fidelity; he refused indignantly; they accused him of
plotting treason, laid hands upon him with one accord, and
gave him in charge to the royal guards, by whom he was
flung into prison.<a id="Anchor_973" href="#Footnote_973" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 973.">[973]</a> As in the case of the seizure of the
bishops, it is difficult to say how far Stephen was responsible,
and how much justification he had, for this arrest. We can
hardly get nearer to the truth than the English chronicler:
“The king took him in Hamton through wicked rede, and
did him in prison; and soon after he let him out again
through worse rede, with the precaution that he swore on
the halidom and found hostages that he should give up all
his castles; some he gave up and some gave he not, and did
then worse than before.”<a id="Anchor_974" href="#Footnote_974" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 974.">[974]</a> But among the castles which
Ralf did give up for the sake of regaining his freedom was
that which Stephen valued most—Lincoln.<a id="Anchor_975" href="#Footnote_975" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 975.">[975]</a> Then at last<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337">337</a></span>
the king felt that his enemies were at his feet; and he
resolved that the city which had beheld his worst overthrow
should also behold his highest triumph. In defiance of an
old superstition which forbade any English king to appear
in regal state within the walls of Lincoln, he kept his midwinter
feast there with a splendour which had been unknown
for years, and wore his crown at high mass in the minster
on Christmas-day.<a id="Anchor_976" href="#Footnote_976" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 976.">[976]</a></p>

<p>The hour of Stephen’s exultation over Matilda in
England was the hour of her husband’s complete triumph
on the other side of the Channel. In the seven years which
had gone by since they parted, the count of Anjou had
really achieved far more than his wife. As soon as he
heard of Stephen’s capture, early in 1141, Geoffrey again
summoned the Norman barons to give up their castles and
submit to his authority in peace. They held a meeting at
Mortagne in the middle of Lent to consider their answer;
despairing of Stephen, yet still unwilling to accept Geoffrey,
they fell back upon their original scheme and once more
besought Theobald of Blois to come and take possession of
both duchy and kingdom. Theobald refused the impossible
task; but, thinking like every one else that all was over
with Stephen, he undertook to arrange terms with Geoffrey
for the pacification of both countries. Stephen’s claims, as
king and duke, were to be given up to the Angevins on
condition that they should set him at liberty and secure to
him and his heirs the honours which he had held during his
uncle’s lifetime; while to Theobald, as the price of his
services in negotiating this settlement, Geoffrey was to
restore the county of Tours.<a id="Anchor_977" href="#Footnote_977" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 977.">[977]</a> The treaty however remained
a dead letter; for one of the contracting parties had reckoned
without his brother and the other without his wife, both
of whom refused their consent. But it served Geoffrey’s
purpose nevertheless. The twin earls of Meulan and
Leicester, hitherto Stephen’s most active partizans, and the
former of whom was after Robert of Gloucester the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338">338</a></span>
influential man in Normandy, at once accepted the proposed
terms as final and made their peace with Anjou.<a id="Anchor_978" href="#Footnote_978" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 978.">[978]</a> Nearly a
third part of the duchy followed their example. Mortagne
had submitted already; Verneuil and Nonancourt soon did
the like; in the last week of Lent Lisieux was surrendered
by its bishop;<a id="Anchor_979" href="#Footnote_979" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 979.">[979]</a> Falaise yielded shortly after;<a id="Anchor_980" href="#Footnote_980" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 980.">[980]</a> and in a few

Geoffrey as its master.<a id="Anchor_981" href="#Footnote_981" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 981.">[981]</a></p>

<p>All this happened while the Empress was in full career
of success in England. There, however, as we have seen,
summer and autumn undid the work of spring; the news of
Matilda’s triumph were quickly followed by those of her fall,
of her brother’s capture, of his release in exchange for
Stephen, and finally, at Whitsuntide 1142, by the visit of
Earl Robert himself to entreat that Geoffrey would come
and help his wife to reconquer her father’s kingdom.
Geoffrey’s views of statecraft were perhaps neither very
wide nor very lofty; but his political instinct was quicker
and more practical than that of either his wife or her brother.
He saw that they had lost their hold upon England; he
knew that he had at last secured a hold upon Normandy;
and he resolved that no temptation from over sea should
induce him to let it go. Instead of helping Robert to
conquer the kingdom, he determined to make Robert help
him to conquer the duchy. He represented that it was
impossible for him to leave matters there in their present
unsatisfactory condition; if the earl really wanted him in
England, he must first help him in bringing Normandy to
order. Thereupon Robert, finding that he could get no
other answer, agreed to join his brother-in-law in a campaign
which occupied them both until the end of the year.<a id="Anchor_982" href="#Footnote_982" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 982.">[982]</a> The
central part of Normandy, from Nonancourt and Lisieux on
the east to a line marked by the course of the Orne on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339">339</a></span>
west, and from the Cenomannian border up to Caen, was
already in Geoffrey’s power; he had in fact inserted a big
wedge into the middle of the duchy. To gain its western
side was the object of the present expedition. The brothers-in-law
seem to have started from Robert’s native Caen, and
their first success was probably the taking of Bastebourg—Bastebourg
above the ford of Varaville, whose name recalls an
earlier time and another Geoffrey of Anjou. Then the expedition
moved south-westward from Caen through the diocese of
Bayeux and up the left bank of the Orne to Villers, Aunay,
Plessis and Vire, till it reached and won the already historic
site of Tinchebray, on the north-eastern frontier of Stephen’s
old county of Mortain.<a id="Anchor_983" href="#Footnote_983" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 983.">[983]</a> The town and castle of Mortain,
and the whole county, with the fortresses of Le Teilleul and
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>-Hilaire, were speedily won.<a id="Anchor_984" href="#Footnote_984" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 984.">[984]</a> Geoffrey marched on to
Pontorson, the south-western outpost of the Norman duchy,
close upon the Breton frontier, at the bottom of a sandy
bay guarded by the Mont-<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>-Michel; warned by the general
experience, the whole population, men and women, townsfolk
and garrison, streamed out to welcome the conqueror
as soon as he made his appearance. Thence he turned
northward again, to Cérences in the Avranchin; and this
place, too, surrendered without striking a blow.<a id="Anchor_985" href="#Footnote_985" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 985.">[985]</a></p>

The story of this campaign, as told by the historians of the time, is little
more than a list of the places taken, put together evidently at random, just as the
names happened to come into the writer’s mind. Its real order must however
have been somewhat as suggested above. The fullest list is in

Tinchebray, <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Hilaire, “Brichesart,” Aunay,
Bastebourg, “Trivères,” Vire, “Plaiseiz,” Villers, Mortain. Bastebourg lies
quite apart from all the rest, and must have been the object of a distinct expedition
from Caen. The other places would follow in geographical order. “Plaiseiz”
may be either Plessis-Grimoult or Placy; “Brichesart” and “Trivères” are still
to be accounted for. There is a Trévières about half-way between Bayeux and
Isigny, but this is even farther away from all the other places than Bastebourg,
and in an opposite direction. From

<p>At this point the campaign of the count and the earl
seems to have been interrupted by tidings of Stephen’s success
and Matilda’s danger at Oxford. That Robert must go
at once was clear; but that it would be wise for Geoffrey to
accompany him was even more doubtful now than it had
been six months ago. A substitute was found in the person
of little Henry Fitz-Empress, who, if he could do nothing
practically to help his mother’s cause and his own, at least
ran no risk of damaging it by raising such a storm of ill-feeling
as would probably have greeted the count of Anjou
himself. While Robert and Henry sailed for England
together, Geoffrey remained to finish his work in Normandy.
Avranches, the next place which he threatened, made a
ready submission; he took up his abode in the castle, and
summoned the lords of all the fortresses in the Avranchin
to come and do him homage, one after another. When
they had all obeyed, he set himself to win the Cotentin.
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>-Lô, which had been strongly fortified by the bishop of
the diocese, surrendered after a three days’ siege. The
victor advanced straight upon Coutances; the bishop was
absent; no one else dared to offer resistance; Geoffrey
simply marched into the city and took it. Thither, as at
Avranches, he summoned the barons of the county to perform
their homage, and they all obeyed except two brothers, Ralf
and Richard of La Haye. Ralf was soon brought to submission;
Richard flung himself with some two hundred
knights into Cherbourg, a mighty fortress on a foundation
of solid rock, guarded on one side by a belt of woodland
full of wild beasts, and on the other by a bay whose advantages
as a naval station have only been put to their full use
in much later times. A siege of Cherbourg was likely to be
a lengthy, troublesome and costly undertaking. But such a
siege was of all military operations that in which Geoffrey
most excelled and most delighted. He had little sympathy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341">341</a></span>
with the downright hand-to-hand fighting by which Fulk
Nerra had won his spurs at Conquereux, or Fulk <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr> had
repulsed Theobald and Stephen before Alençon, or Stephen
had put his very captors to shame beneath the walls of
Lincoln. Engineering was Geoffrey’s favourite science; in
its developement he spared neither labour nor expense; and
he now brought up against Cherbourg such a formidable
array of machines that Richard thought it prudent to slip
away by sea, intending to go to England and ask help of
King Stephen. He was however overtaken by pirates and
carried away “among strange peoples”; and a rumour of
his fate reaching the garrison whom he had left behind, they
lost heart and made submission to the Angevin.<a id="Anchor_986" href="#Footnote_986" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 986.">[986]</a> The whole
duchy south and west of the Seine was now his,<a id="Anchor_987" href="#Footnote_987" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 987.">[987]</a> except the
one town of Vaudreuil; before the close of the year this,
too, was won, and the Angevin power even advanced beyond
the river, for “Walter Giffard and all the people of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pays
de Caux</i> made agreement with Count Geoffrey.”<a id="Anchor_988" href="#Footnote_988" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 988.">[988]</a> The Norman
capital now stood out alone against the Angevin
conqueror of Normandy, as Tours had once stood out alone
against the conqueror of Touraine. In January 1144
Geoffrey crossed the Seine at Vernon and pitched his camp
at La Trinité-du-Mont, close to the walls of Rouen.<a id="Anchor_989" href="#Footnote_989" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 989.">[989]</a> Next

overlord of Normandy, the young King Louis <abbr title="7">VII.</abbr> of
France. All was changed since the days when his father,
Louis <abbr title="6">VI.</abbr>, had granted the investiture of Normandy to
Stephen’s little son. The inveterate enmity between the
house of Blois and the French Crown had broken out afresh,
in a new and most disastrous form, between Count Theobald
and the young king; Louis fell back upon the traditional
policy of his forefathers and gladly embraced the Angevin
alliance against all the branches of the house of Blois on
both sides of the sea. Thus when Geoffrey, after composing
matters as well as he could at Rouen, mustered his forces
to subdue the few still outstanding castles, he was joined at
once by his own brother-in-law Theodoric of Flanders and by
the king of France. Driencourt was the first place won by
their united hosts; then Lions-la-Forêt—the old hunting-seat
where King Henry had died—was given up by Hugh of
Gournay;<a id="Anchor_993" href="#Footnote_993" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 993.">[993]</a> the rest of the castles beyond Seine were quickly
won, and then Geoffrey was master of the whole Norman
duchy,<a id="Anchor_994" href="#Footnote_994" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 994.">[994]</a> save one fortress, Arques, which a Fleming called
William the Monk held so pertinaciously for Stephen that
the Angevin was obliged to leave a body of troops before
the place and go home without waiting to finish the siege
in person.<a id="Anchor_995" href="#Footnote_995" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 995.">[995]</a> Next summer the “monk” was shot dead by
a chance arrow, and the surrender of Arques completed
Geoffrey’s conquest of Normandy.<a id="Anchor_996" href="#Footnote_996" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 996.">[996]</a> He made no pretence
of holding it in the name of either his wife or his son; it was
his own by right of conquest, and that right was formally
acknowledged by the king of France. Before they parted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343">343</a></span>

<p>The Angevin conqueror had been called home by a
revolt among his own barons.<a id="Anchor_998" href="#Footnote_998" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 998.">[998]</a> The leader was, as before,
Robert of Sablé;<a id="Anchor_999" href="#Footnote_999" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 999.">[999]</a> but there was worse to come. Geoffrey’s
brother Elias was persuaded by the rebels to put forth a
claim to the county of Maine and uphold his pretension by
force of arms. Geoffrey defeated him, took him prisoner,
and put him in ward at Tours,<a id="Anchor_1000" href="#Footnote_1000" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1000.">[1000]</a> where he remained five years,
and whence he was released only to die of the effects of his
imprisonment.<a id="Anchor_1001" href="#Footnote_1001" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1001.">[1001]</a> The revolt failed as all previous revolts
against Geoffrey had failed; the count swooped down upon
Robert and his accomplices with such irresistible energy
that they were utterly confounded and made submission at
once.<a id="Anchor_1002" href="#Footnote_1002" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1002.">[1002]</a> Undisputed master from the Poitevin border to the
English Channel, Geoffrey once more cast his eyes across
the sea, not with any thought of joining his wife in her
desperate venture, but with an uneasy longing to get his
heir safe out of the entanglement of a losing cause and
bring him home to share in his own triumph. He therefore
sent envoys to Earl Robert, begging that Henry might be
allowed to come and see him, if only for a short time. The
request was at once granted, and by Ascension-tide 1147
the boy was again at his father’s side.<a id="Anchor_1003" href="#Footnote_1003" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1003.">[1003]</a> His uncle the earl
of Gloucester had escorted him as far as Wareham;<a id="Anchor_1004" href="#Footnote_1004" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1004.">[1004]</a> there
they parted, as it turned out, for the last time. Robert<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344">344</a></span>
caught a fever and died at Bristol early in the following
November.<a id="Anchor_1005" href="#Footnote_1005" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1005.">[1005]</a> Then at last the Empress herself felt that all
was lost. Her last faint chance had expired with the wise
and valiant brother whose patient devotion she had never
fully appreciated until it was too late. In the early spring
of 1148 she gave up the struggle and followed her son back
to Normandy, to live thenceforth in peace by her husband’s
side;<a id="Anchor_1006" href="#Footnote_1006" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1006.">[1006]</a> while the knot which the sword had failed to cut was
left to be slowly disentangled by more skilful hands which
had long been preparing for their task.</p>

<span class="note_title">THE TOPOGRAPHY OF THE BATTLE OF LINCOLN.</span></h4>

<p>The topography of the battle of Lincoln is a very puzzling matter.
We have two sources of information, and it seems impossible to
make them agree. The questions to be solved are two: 1. Which
way did Robert and Ralf approach the city? 2. Where was the
battle actually fought?</p>

<p>1. The first question lies between William of Malmesbury and
Henry of Huntingdon. William
    (<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Historia Novella">Hist. Nov.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="book 3">l. iii.</abbr> <abbr title="chapters">cc.</abbr> 39, 40;
Hardy, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 741</cite>) says distinctly that the main army started from
Gloucester; that Ralf and his troops joined them somewhere on
the road; that Stephen, hearing of their approach, left off besieging
the castle and went forth to meet them; and that on Candlemas
day they arrived “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad flumen quod inter duos exercitus præterfluebat,
Trenta nomine, quod et ortu suo et pluviarum profluvio
tam magnum fuerat ut nullatenus vado transitum præberet</span>.” He
then gives the story of the crossing. Henry of Huntingdon
    (<cite><abbr title="book 8">l. viii.</abbr>
<abbr title="chapter">c.</abbr> 13; Arnold, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 268</cite>) describes the crossing much in the same
way, except that the “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">consul audacissimus</span>” to whom he attributes
the first plunge seems to be Ralf, whereas in William’s version
Robert is the hero. But Henry makes no mention of the Trent;
in his story the plunge is into “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">paludem pœne intransibilem</span>.”</p>

<p>For both these versions there is something to be said. The
authority of the two witnesses is very evenly balanced. Chronologically,
both are equally near to their subject. Geographically, the
archdeacon of Huntingdon is nearer than the librarian of Malmesbury<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345">345</a></span>;
but he is not a whit more likely to have been personally
present; and if Henry may have got his information from Bishop
Alexander, William may just as probably have got his from Earl
Robert himself. The question therefore becomes one of the intrinsic
probability of the two stories. Here again there is something
to be said for William; for although the most direct and obvious
road from Gloucester to Lincoln would undoubtedly be the Foss-Way,
along the eastern side of the Trent valley, yet it is possible
that the earls might have chosen a more unusual route along its
western side, just because it would seem less likely to their enemies.
Yet we can hardly accept William’s version; for the fording of the
Trent, especially in winter, and when its waters were—as he himself
tells us—swollen with heavy rains, would be little short of a physical
impossibility. At the origin of his mistake (or of Earl Robert’s, for
it must surely have been Robert who told him the story) we may
perhaps be able to guess. The writer of the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta Stephani</i> (Sewell,
<abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 71)</cite>
says nothing of either river or marsh; the only thing which
he mentions is a ford, of whose whereabouts he gives no indication
whatever. “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cumque fortissimam <span class="dots">...</span> [Stephanus] præmississet
cohortem in exitu cujusdam vadi eis ad obsistendum, illi <span class="dots">...</span> cum
violentiâ in ipsos irruentes vadum occupaverunt.</span>” Now, if the
earls had followed the Foss-Way quite up to Lincoln, it would have
brought them not to any ford, but to the bridge over the Witham,
leading directly into the city by the south gate. But the city was
bitterly hostile to them; had they attempted to pass through it to
reach the castle, they must have cut their way through a crowd of
enemies. There was however another and a much more practicable
route open to them. Some little distance to westward of the bridge,
the Witham at its junction with the Foss-Dyke expands into a broad
sheet of water known by the name of Brayford. The kindness of
the Rev. Precentor Venables has enabled me to ascertain that half
way between the bridge and Brayford Head (<i>i.e.</i> the eastern end of
this sheet of water) there still exists in the bed of the river a well-paved
ford road, probably of Roman origin. By this ford the army
could cross the river and advance towards the castle without entering
the town at all; and I feel little doubt that this was the ford at
which Stephen posted the guard mentioned by his biographer, and
across which the two earls swam with their followers. In that case
William of Malmesbury’s mistake as to the name of the river is not
surprising. The Foss-Dyke unites the Witham and the Trent; a
medieval geographer could hardly be expected to know accurately
where the one ended and the other began. Out of the three names
so closely connected, he not unnaturally chose the one most generally
known, and concluded the whole water-way under the comprehensive
name of Trent; while on the other hand, the overflowing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346">346</a></span>
of dyke and river may quite sufficiently account for Henry of
Huntingdon having described them and the flooded ground on each
side of them all together as an “almost impassable marsh.”</p>

<p>2. Local tradition persists in asserting that the battle was fought
to the north of the city, somewhere beyond the New Port. If this
was so, Stephen must have led his troops out of the city by the old
Roman way—the Ermine Street—through the New Port, and drawn
them up on the plateau formed by the top of the range of hills
whose southern extremity is occupied by the city itself; and his
enemies, after crossing the water, must have marched all round the
south-western foot of the hill, below the castle, and then climbed
the western slope to meet Stephen on the top. Such a manœuvre is
doubtless possible; but it hardly seems to agree with the indications—provokingly
few and slight though they are—given us by the
historians. None of them indeed tells us which way Stephen went
forth; the nearest approach to a clear statement is that of his own
biographer, who says “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">extra civitatem obvius eis audacter occurrit</span>”
    (<cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta <abbr title="Stephani">Steph.</abbr></i> as above</cite>). Now marching up northward can hardly
be called “going forth boldly to meet” an enemy who was coming
from the south-west. The tradition in fact is in itself very improbable,
and has no evidence to support it. In 1881 I made two
attempts at a personal examination of the topography, with the help
of indications kindly furnished me by Precentor Venables. The
result was as follows: The western wall of the castle-enclosure does
not stretch to the extreme edge of the hill; beyond it lies a part of
the plateau, now occupied by the County Asylum, and marked by
Stukeley as the site of Stephen’s encampment. Stukeley was probably
misled by the circumstance that an adjoining bit of ground was
called “Battle-piece”—a name which is now known to have been
derived not from any battle fought there, but from the place having
been set apart for trials by battle. But farther to the west there
lies at the foot of the ridge a tract of comparatively level ground,
rising slightly on the one side to join the slope of the hill, and on
the other gradually sinking into the lower land which spreads to the
bank of the Trent. This tract—part of it is now a race-course—seems
to be really the only place in which it is possible for the two
armies to have met. The ground immediately south of the castle,
between its outer wall and the northern bank of the Foss-Dyke, is
too steep to allow of anything like a pitched battle between two
formally-arrayed armies. The earls after crossing the ford could
hardly do anything but lead their troops round the foot of the hill,
to draw them up at last on the western side of the level tract above
described. Stephen, on the other hand, could hardly have chosen
a better post for defence than its eastern side, with the ridge of the
hill at his back.</p>

<span class="ch1">CHAPTER <abbr title="7">VII.</abbr></span><br />

<span class="ch2">THE ENGLISH CHURCH.</span><br />

<span class="ch3">1136–1149.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> departure of the Empress was followed by a time of
comparative quiet; but it was the quiet of exhaustion, not
of rest. In the twelve years which had passed away since
King Henry’s death all his work seemed to have been utterly
undone. Every vestige of law and authority, order and
peace, had been swept away by the torrent of destruction
which in those twelve years had overwhelmed the whole
country. When at last the waves began to subside, one ark
of refuge was found to have escaped the general desolation;
one vessel alone had been able to outride the storm. The
state was a wreck; the Church remained.</p>

<p>The pilot of the sacred bark, during the first seven years
of Stephen’s reign, had been the king’s brother Henry,
bishop of Winchester. The youngest child of Stephen-Henry
and Adela of Blois, devoted by his mother to the
religious life, had been brought up in the famous abbey of
Cluny; thence, in 1126, he was summoned by his uncle the
king of England to become abbot of one of the most
ancient and illustrious monasteries in Britain, that of Glastonbury;
and three years later the young abbot—he cannot
have been more than twenty-eight—was raised to the
bishopric of Winchester.<a id="Anchor_1007" href="#Footnote_1007" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1007.">[1007]</a> His rapid advancement was no
doubt owing to the personal favour of his uncle; but none
the less did it place in the important see of Winchester a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348">348</a></span>
prelate as different in temper as in origin from the crowd of
low-born secular clerks who then filled the ranks of the
English episcopate. Steeped in ecclesiastical and monastic
traditions from his very cradle, Henry was before all things
a churchman and a monk. It was to him and to men like
him that the religious revival which sprang up in his uncle’s
later years naturally looked for the guidance which it could
not find either in the secular bishops or in the shy, irresolute
primate; and the consequences appeared as soon as
the king was dead, when the helm of the state and that of
the Church—the one dropped by Roger of Salisbury, the
other never firmly grasped by William of Canterbury—were
both at once taken by the young bishop of Winchester.
His personal influence sufficed to ensure his brother’s election
to the throne; the legatine commission sent to him in 1139,
overriding the claims of the new primate, made him the
acknowledged leader of the English Church, and, coinciding
as it did with the complete break-down of all secular
government at Bishop Roger’s fall, practically vested in him
and in the clerical synods which he convened the sole remnant
of deliberative and legislative authority throughout
the kingdom. Clergy and people followed him like a flock
of sheep; yet he was never really trusted by either of the
two political parties, because he never really belonged to
either. His own political ideal was independent of all party
considerations. It was the ideal of the ecclesiastical statesman
in the strictest sense: to insure the well-being of the
state by securing the rights and privileges and enforcing the
discipline of the Church. In his eyes the whole machinery
of secular government, including the sovereign, existed solely
for that one end, and he carried out his theory to its logical
result in the synods which deposed Stephen and Matilda
each in turn, as each in turn broke the compact with the
Church which had raised them to the throne. Of the use
to be made in later days of the precedent thus created he
and his brother-clergy never dreamed; they are, however,
entitled to the credit of having been the only branch of the
body-politic which made an organized effort to rescue England
from the chaos into which she had fallen. The failure<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349">349</a></span>
of their efforts hitherto was due partly to the overwhelming
force of circumstances, partly to the character of Henry himself.
His temper was like that of the uncle whose name he
bore—the calm, imperturbable Norman temper which neither
interest nor passion could throw off its balance or off its
guard; and with the Norman coolness he had also the
Norman tenacity, fearlessness and strength of will. But
although the main elements of his nature were thus derived
from his mother’s ancestors, he had not altogether escaped
the doom of his father’s house. He was free from the worst
defect of his race, their fatal unsteadiness of purpose; but
he had his full share of their rashness, their self-will, and
their peculiar mental short-sightedness. His policy really
had a definite and a noble end, but his endeavours to compass
that end were little more than a series of bold experiments.
Moreover, his conception of the end itself was out
of harmony with the requirements of the time. Churchman
as he was to the core, his churchmanship was almost as
unlike that of the rising generation, trained up under the
influence of the new religious orders, as the downright
worldliness of the Salisbury school with which some of
them were, though most unjustly, half inclined to confound
him. He belonged to a type of ecclesiastical statesmen, or
rather political churchmen, who did not shrink from arraying
the Church militant in the spoils of earthly triumph, and
would fain elevate her above the world in outward pomp
and majesty no less than in inward purity and holiness.
This was the school of which Cluny had been, ever since
the days of Gregory <abbr title="7">VII.</abbr>, the citadel and stronghold; and
Henry was thus attached to it by all the associations of his
youth as well as by his own natural disposition. But in the
second quarter of the twelfth century this Cluniac school
was losing its hold upon the finer and loftier spirits of the
time, and the influence of Cluny was beginning to pale before
the purer radiance diffused from <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard’s “bright
valley,” Clairvaux.</p>

<p>Henry’s legatine commission, too, which was a chief
source of his strength, was really a source of moral and
spiritual weakness to the English Church; for it set him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350">350</a></span>
over the head of the man who ought to have been her representative
and leader, and placed in the hands of a mere
diocesan bishop all, and more than all, the power and
authority which belonged of right to the primate of all
Britain.<a id="Anchor_1008" href="#Footnote_1008" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1008.">[1008]</a> Until very recent times the English Church had
been, by an unwritten but perfectly well-established privilege
of immemorial antiquity, exempt from all legatine control;
papal envoys were admitted only for special purposes, and
exercised no authority within the province of the “transmarine
Pope”—the primate of all Britain. In technical
language, the archbishop of Canterbury, as successor of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Augustine, was by virtue of his office <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legatus natus</i> of the
Holy See, and therefore not subject to the jurisdiction of a
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legatus a latere</i>. During the reign of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> three attempts
had been made to break through this venerable tradition;
on the third occasion, in 1125, the outrageous behaviour of
the legate John of Crema roused Archbishop William to go
and protest at Rome, whence he returned clothed in his own
person with the functions of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">legatus a latere</i>.<a id="Anchor_1009" href="#Footnote_1009" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1009.">[1009]</a> This commission,
granted by Honorius <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, was renewed by Innocent,<a id="Anchor_1010" href="#Footnote_1010" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1010.">[1010]</a>
and William thus retained it until his death. When that
event occurred Henry of Winchester must have felt himself,
and must have been generally felt throughout the country,
to be almost naturally marked out for William’s successor.
It seems, indeed, that he was actually elected to the vacant
primacy. There was however a difficulty which proved to
be insuperable. The translation of a bishop from one see
to another could only be effected by a special license from
the Pope; and in this case the license was apparently refused.<a id="Anchor_1011" href="#Footnote_1011" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1011.">[1011]</a>
Driven thus to seek elsewhere for a primate,
Stephen, or it may be Stephen’s wiser queen, sought him
in the home of Lanfranc and Anselm, and brought over a
third abbot of Bec to walk in the steps and sit on the throne<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351">351</a></span>
of his sainted predecessors at Canterbury.<a id="Anchor_1012" href="#Footnote_1012" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1012.">[1012]</a> Theobald came
of a good Norman family, and was well reported of for
learning, virtue and piety;<a id="Anchor_1013" href="#Footnote_1013" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1013.">[1013]</a> further than that, the world as
yet knew nothing of him; it was therefore not unnatural,
though it was distinctly unfortunate, that when Pope Innocent
<abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> determined to appoint a resident legate in England
he appointed Henry instead of Theobald.</p>

<p>For several years the archbishop bore his supersession
quietly. His political sympathies appear to have always
inclined to the side of the Empress, but his conduct shewed
no trace of party spirit; no personal jealousy on his part
ever thwarted Henry’s attempts at pacification. He doubtless
felt that he could afford to wait; for his metropolitical
rights, though kept in abeyance for a time, were inalienable
and independent of all outward accidents, while the legatine
authority was drawn solely from the commission of an individual
Pope, and a change either of persons or of policy at
Rome might at any moment reduce Henry of Winchester
to the rank of a mere suffragan bishop. Henry himself was
so conscious of this danger that he began to urge upon his
patron Innocent a project for raising the see of Winchester
to metropolitical rank and furnishing it with two (or, according
to another account, seven) suffragan sees, to be carved
out of the southern part of the province of Canterbury.
This wild scheme was so far endorsed by Innocent that he
actually sent Henry a pall, the emblem of archiepiscopal
dignity, in 1142; so, at least, the story ran.<a id="Anchor_1014" href="#Footnote_1014" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1014.">[1014]</a> As yet, however,
the matter rested wholly between legate and Pope;
if the archbishop knew anything of their plots against him,
he was wise enough to let them plot undisturbed. Instead
of trying to fish in the troubled waters of the present, he
was looking to the open sea of the future and meditating
how best to prepare himself, his Church and his adopted
country for the voyage which lay before them. While the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352">352</a></span>
legate was making and unmaking sovereigns and plotting a
revolution in the Anglican hierarchy, the primate was
quietly gathering into his own household the choicest
spirits of the time, drawing around him a group of earnest,
deep-thinking students, of highly-cultured, large-minded,
dispassionate politicians; in a word, making his palace
the seminary and the training-college, the refuge and the
home, of a new generation of English scholars and English
statesmen.</p>

<p>Foremost among them stood Thomas the son of Gilbert
Becket, ex-port-reeve of London. Troubles had fallen
heavy upon Gilbert and his wife since the days when from
their comfortable home in Cheapside their boy rode forth to
his school at Merton or to his hawking excursions with
Richer de l’Aigle. A series of disastrous fires had brought
them down from affluence almost to poverty<a id="Anchor_1015" href="#Footnote_1015" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1015.">[1015]</a> and compelled
them to take their son away from school at an earlier age
than the mother, at least, would have desired. She watched
over his studies with the deepest interest and care,<a id="Anchor_1016" href="#Footnote_1016" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1016.">[1016]</a> and it
was probably her influence and good management which,
after an interval of idleness at home, sent him off again to
study for a short time in Paris.<a id="Anchor_1017" href="#Footnote_1017" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1017.">[1017]</a> The boy learned quickly
and easily, as he did everything to which he chose to put
his hand and give his mind; but his heart was set upon
riding and hawking and the sports and occupations of active
life, far more than upon the book-learning to which he devoted
himself chiefly for the sake of pleasing his mother;
and when she died, in his twenty-second year,<a id="Anchor_1018" href="#Footnote_1018" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1018.">[1018]</a> his studies
came to an end. Her death broke up the home; Gilbert,
worn out with age and grief, was powerless to guide or help
his son; and Thomas soon found it impossible to make<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353">353</a></span>
their scanty means sufficient to maintain them both.<a id="Anchor_1019" href="#Footnote_1019" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1019.">[1019]</a> Irksome
as the work must have been to such a temper as his,
he took a situation as clerk in the counting-house of a kinsman,
Osbern Huitdeniers, or “Eightpenny” as we might
perhaps call him now.<a id="Anchor_1020" href="#Footnote_1020" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1020.">[1020]</a> Osbern was a wealthy man, enjoying
great consideration both in the city and at court;<a id="Anchor_1021" href="#Footnote_1021" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1021.">[1021]</a> at
this time—just after the outbreak of the civil war—he seems
to have been one of the sheriffs of London, for we are told
that Thomas himself held a subordinate civic post as clerk
and accountant to those functionaries.<a id="Anchor_1022" href="#Footnote_1022" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1022.">[1022]</a> For two or three
years, the years of the personal struggle between Stephen
and Matilda, Thomas endured the drudgery of the office as
best he might,<a id="Anchor_1023" href="#Footnote_1023" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1023.">[1023]</a> till at length a more congenial position was
offered him, first in the household of his old friend Richer
de l’Aigle<a id="Anchor_1024" href="#Footnote_1024" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1024.">[1024]</a> and then in that of Archbishop Theobald. When
the war-storm had partly subsided and the primate was
beginning to organize his plans, some of his clerks who had
been guests at the little house in Cheapside in its prosperous
days remembered the bright boy whom they had often
noticed there, and determined to enlist him in their own
ranks. One of them, known to us only by his nickname of
“Baille-hache” or the “Hatchet,” undertook to persuade
the young man himself;<a id="Anchor_1025" href="#Footnote_1025" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1025.">[1025]</a> two others, Baldwin the archdeacon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354">354</a></span>
and Eustace his brother, commended him and his
father to the primate. It chanced that Gilbert, though he
had been domiciled at Rouen before his emigration to
England, was a native of Thierceville, close to the Bec-Herlouin.
A chat with Thomas’s father over old times and
old names around Bec made its former abbot all the more
disposed to welcome Thomas himself, when he rode out to
Harrow and let his friend Baille-hache present him to the
archbishop.<a id="Anchor_1026" href="#Footnote_1026" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1026.">[1026]</a> Before many months had passed he was admitted
to the innermost circle of Theobald’s confidential
counsellors. That circle consisted of three young men—John
of Canterbury, Roger of Pont-l’Evêque and Thomas
of London. Without consulting one or other of these
three the archbishop rarely did anything;<a id="Anchor_1027" href="#Footnote_1027" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1027.">[1027]</a> and in matters
of special difficulty or delicacy he relied mainly upon
Thomas.<a id="Anchor_1028" href="#Footnote_1028" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1028.">[1028]</a></p>

<p>He had secured his services at the right moment; for
the long impending crisis between himself and the legate
was now fast drawing near. In purely secular politics
Theobald had hitherto been content to follow Henry’s lead;
on a question of ecclesiastical politics they had now come
to a distinct severance. Archbishop Thurstan of York had
died in February 1140;<a id="Anchor_1029" href="#Footnote_1029" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1029.">[1029]</a> in January 1141 William, treasurer
of the see, was appointed in his stead, and received the investiture
of the temporalities from Stephen in the camp
before Lincoln.<a id="Anchor_1030" href="#Footnote_1030" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1030.">[1030]</a> The appointment had somewhat the look
of a court job; for William was a nephew of the king and
the legate;<a id="Anchor_1031" href="#Footnote_1031" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1031.">[1031]</a> he had been brought up in wealth, luxury
and idleness, and although of amiable and blameless character,
was obviously not the man for such a post as the
northern primacy. A minority of the York chapter therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355">355</a></span>
supported by many of the most respected clergy of the
province, chief among whom was Abbot Richard of Fountains,
protested against the election as having been procured
by undue influence, in the form of bribery on William’s own
part and intimidation on that of William of Aumale, earl
of York, acting on behalf of the king and the legate; and
this view was shared by the southern primate. The legate,
apparently shrinking from the responsibility of consecrating
his nephew by his own sole authority (for Theobald absolutely
refused to assist him), let the matter rest during the
remainder of that troubled year and then sent the elect of
York to plead his own cause at Rome. In Lent 1143 the
Pope gave his decision: “If Dean William of York can
swear that the chapter did not receive through the earl of
Aumale a command from the king to elect his nephew: and
if the archbishop-elect himself can swear that he did not
seek his election by bribery<span class="nobreak">:—</span>then let him be consecrated.”
A council met at Winchester in September to receive the
two oaths and witness the consecration. The dean of York,
however, was unable to attend; he had been elected to the
bishopric of Durham, and was absorbed in struggling for the
possession of his see with an intruder named William Cumin,
who had been placed there by the king of Scots. The
partizans of the archbishop-elect, foreseeing some obstacle of
this kind, had procured the addition to the Pope’s decree of
a saving clause whereby they were permitted to substitute
“some other approved person” for the dean: such, at least,
was their account of the matter. Ralf, bishop of Orkney,

<p>Henry was triumphant; but it was his last triumph. On
that very day a new Pope, Celestine <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>, was chosen in place
of Innocent, who had died two days before. The legatine<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356">356</a></span>
commission expired with the Pope who had granted it; the
bishop of Winchester became again a mere suffragan of
Canterbury, and Theobald suddenly found himself primate
in fact as well as in name. Everything now depended on
the dispositions of the new Pope. Accordingly, early in
November both Theobald and Henry set out for Rome.<a id="Anchor_1034" href="#Footnote_1034" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1034.">[1034]</a>
The latter soon learned that his journey was useless;
Celestine was “a favourer of the Angevins”;<a id="Anchor_1035" href="#Footnote_1035" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1035.">[1035]</a> and when
Theobald and his confidant Thomas arrived at Rome they
found no difficulty in persuading the Pope to transfer the
legatine commission from the bishop of Winchester to the
primate.<a id="Anchor_1036" href="#Footnote_1036" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1036.">[1036]</a> Henry consoled himself by turning aside to Cluny
and spending a quiet winter in the home of his boyhood.
Next spring came another change; Celestine died on March
9, 1144, and was succeeded by Lucius <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> To Lucius
Henry went, and in his eyes he found at least so much
favour that he was acquitted of sundry charges brought
against him by emissaries from Anjou. But the legation
was apparently left altogether in abeyance; if it was not
renewed to Theobald—a point which is not quite clear—it
was at any rate not restored to Henry.<a id="Anchor_1037" href="#Footnote_1037" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1037.">[1037]</a></p>

<p>The tide which had borne both Henry and Stephen to
their triumph was in truth now rising far above their heads.
The religious movement of which Henry had once seemed
destined to become a leader had gone sweeping on till it
left him far behind. It was the one element of national
life whose growth, instead of being checked, seems to have
been actually fostered by the anarchy. The only bright
pages in the story of those “nineteen winters” are the pages
in the
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Monasticon Anglicanum</i></cite>
which tell of the progress and
the work of the new religious orders, and shew us how, while
knights and barons, king and Empress, were turning the
fairest regions of England into a wilderness, Templars and
Hospitaliers were setting up their priories, Austin canons
were directing schools and serving hospitals, and the sons of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357">357</a></span>
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard were making the very desert to rejoice and
blossom as the rose. The vigour of the movement shewed
itself in the diversity of forms which it assumed. Most of
them were offshoots of the Order of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Augustine. The
Augustinian schools were the best in England; the “Black
Canons” excelled as teachers; they excelled yet more as
nurses and guardians of the poor. One of the most attractive
features of the time is the great number of hospices, hospitals,
or almshouses as we should call them now, established for
the reception and maintenance of the aged, the needy and
the infirm. Such were the two famous houses of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Giles,
Cripplegate, and <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bartholomew, Smithfield; such was the
Hospital of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Katharine near the Tower, founded in 1148
by Stephen’s queen Matilda, and served by the canons of
Holy Trinity at Aldgate, to whom the younger “good Queen
Maude” was almost as devoted a friend as her aunt and
namesake had been. Such, too, was another foundation
whose white church, nestling amid a clump of trees in the
meadows through which the little blue Itchen goes winding
down to the sea, is the only unmutilated remnant that
Winchester still retains of the handiwork of her legate-bishop
Henry. There, before he built his own fortified house,
Henry founded for thirteen poor old men the Hospital of
the Holy Cross; and there, while the dwelling which he
made so strong for himself has perished, the “Almshouse of
noble Poverty” still stands—the hospital indeed rebuilt
by a later bishop to whom it owes its poetical name, but
the church unaltered since its founder’s days—a lasting
memorial of that better, spiritual side of his character which
the world least saw and least believed in. Another class
of hospitals was destined for the reception of poor travellers,
especially pilgrims. Such had been, in far-off Palestine, the
original purpose of two societies of pious laymen which had
now made their way back into Europe and even into England
in the shape of two great military orders, the Hospitaliers
or Knights of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> John and the Templars. They, too,
lived by the rule of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Austin. Another offshoot of the
Augustinian order consisted of the White Canons or Premonstratensians
(so called from their first establishment at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358">358</a></span>
Prémontré in the diocese of Laon), for whom, in the midst
of the civil war, Peter de Gousla endowed a priory at Newhouse
in Lincolnshire, while his wife founded a house at
Brodholm in Nottinghamshire for sisters of the same order.<a id="Anchor_1038" href="#Footnote_1038" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1038.">[1038]</a>
“What shall we think,” exclaims an inmate of one of the
great Augustinian houses of Yorkshire, William of Newburgh,—“what
shall we think of all these religious places which
in King Stephen’s time began more abundantly to arise and
to flourish, but that they are God’s castles, wherein the
servants of the true Anointed King do keep watch, and His
young soldiers are exercised in warfare against spiritual
evil? For indeed at that time, when the royal authority
had lost all vigour, the mighty men of the realm, and whosoever
was able, were all building castles either for their own
protection or for their neighbours’ hurt; and thus while
through King Stephen’s weakness, or rather through the
malice of the Devil, who is ever a nourisher of strife, evils
were swarming and abundant, there did yet more abound
and more gloriously shine forth the wise and salutary
providence of the Almighty King, Who at that very
time did the more mightily confound the king of pride
by raising up for Himself such fortresses as beseemed the
King of Peace. For in the short while that Stephen
reigned, or rather bore the title of king, there arose in
England many more dwellings of the servants and handmaids
of God than had arisen there in the course of the
whole previous century.”<a id="Anchor_1039" href="#Footnote_1039" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1039.">[1039]</a></p>

<p>It is significant that this enthusiastic outburst of the
historian-canon of Newburgh is called forth by the contemplation
not of his own order, but of three great Cistercian
houses, Byland, Rievaux and Fountains. Buried in their
lonely wildernesses, the Cistercians seem at first glance to
have been intent only on saving their own souls, taking no
part in the regeneration of society at large. But the truth
is far otherwise. While the other orders were—if we may
venture to take up the suggestive figure employed by William<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359">359</a></span>
of Newburgh—the working, fighting rank and file of the
spiritual army, the White Monks were at once its sentinels,
its guides and its commanding officers; they kept watch
and ward over its organization and its safety, they pointed
the way wherein it should go, they directed its energies and
inspired its action. For the never-ending crusade of the
Church against the world had at this time found its leader
in a simple Cistercian monk, who never was Pope, nor legate,
nor archbishop, nor even official head of his own order—who
was simply abbot of Clairvaux—yet who, by the irresistible,
unconscious influence of a pure mind and a single aim, had
brought all Christendom to his feet. It was to the “Bright
Valley,” to Clairvaux, that men looked from the most distant
lands for light amid the darkness; it was to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard that
all instinctively turned for counsel and for guidance. The
story of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Gilbert of Sempringham may serve for an example.
The father of Gilbert was a Norman holding
property in Lincolnshire in the time of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>; his
mother was a woman of Old-English descent. The boy
ran away from school and made his escape to France; there
he repented of his idleness, threw himself zealously into the
pursuit of letters, and after some years came home to set up
in his native place a school for boys and girls. He taught
them a great deal more than mere book-learning; his purity,
sweetness and fervour won the very hearts and souls of all
who came under his influence; and there was something in
his lofty yet tender nature which made him seem peculiarly
fitted for a spiritual director of women. Seven maidens
first devoted themselves to the religious life under his guidance;
others soon followed their example; several men did
the like. A double monastery thus grew up at Sempringham,
under the protection of Bishop Alexander of Lincoln,
in the earliest years of Stephen’s reign. For some time it
continued subject to no other rule than its founder’s own
will. He saw, however, the necessity for a more lasting
basis of organization; instead of trying to devise one himself,
he applied to the general chapter of Cîteaux and
besought them to take charge of his little flock. They,
however, refused; since Gilbert had been inspired to found<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360">360</a></span>
a new religious society, they would not presume to interfere
with his mission; he must draw up a rule for his own
spiritual children. He ended by working out his scheme
into a composite institution which aimed at combining the
excellencies of all earlier rules, but in which the Cistercian
element strongly predominated. The Gilbertine priories,
when fully constituted, consisted of four orders of persons:
canons, who followed the rule of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Austin; lay-brethren,
nuns and lay-sisters, all bound by the rule of Cîteaux;
while the whole community was held together by certain
additional regulations specially devised by the founder. The
new order spread rapidly through eastern England; and
before <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Gilbert’s own life reached its close, he had the
satisfaction of seeing his spiritual children take a highly
honourable part in the great ecclesiastical struggle of which
the foremost champion and victim was <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Thomas of Canterbury.<a id="Anchor_1040" href="#Footnote_1040" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1040.">[1040]</a></p>

<p>One sees in this story how instinctively the religious
reformers of the day went to Cîteaux for a model and a
guide; and one sees, too, how little the Cistercians were
as yet inclined to abuse their influence by reaping where
they had not sown. The extraordinary position of Bernard
himself was not of his own seeking; the “care of all the
churches” came upon him whether he would or not; as one
of his biographers expresses it, all Christendom looked upon
him as a divinely-appointed Moses of whom the ordained
hierarchy and even the supreme pontiff himself were but
subordinate mouthpieces and representatives.<a id="Anchor_1041" href="#Footnote_1041" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1041.">[1041]</a> Like their
prototype in the Old Testament, the Aarons of the time
did not always understand the policy or appreciate the aims
of their inspired brother, and the spiritual party in the
Church sometimes found its worst stumbling-block within
the walls of the Lateran. Year by year, however, its influence
grew and spread, till on the death of Pope Lucius
<abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> in February 1145 a Cistercian, Bernard abbot of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361">361</a></span>
Anastasius at Rome, was raised to the chair of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Peter by
the name of Eugene <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> With him the anti-Bernardine
party had no chance of a moment’s hearing; threats, flatteries
or bribes were all alike thrown away upon a pontiff
whose glory and whose strength lay in having no will of his
own, in being simply the voice which proclaimed and the
hand which executed the thoughts of his greater namesake
at Clairvaux. “They say I am Pope, not you!” wrote <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Bernard to him,<a id="Anchor_1042" href="#Footnote_1042" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1042.">[1042]</a> half playfully, half in gentle reproach, and
Eugene gloried in the saying. A new departure in the
policy of the Roman see was marked by the fulfilment of
one of Bernard’s most cherished schemes, the preaching of
a new crusade for the deliverance of the Holy Land, whence
an imploring cry for help came from the widowed Queen
Melisenda—for King Fulk of Anjou had been cut off suddenly
in the midst of his labours, and his realm, left to the
rule of a woman and a child, was rapidly falling a prey to
the Infidels.<a id="Anchor_1043" href="#Footnote_1043" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1043.">[1043]</a> At Vézelay, on Easter-day 1146, the young
King Louis of France took the cross from <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard’s own
hands amid a scene of the wildest enthusiasm. The Emperor
Conrad soon followed his example, and at Pentecost
1147 the expedition set out.</p>

<p>As far as its direct object was concerned, this second
crusade failed completely; yet it had not been projected in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362">362</a></span>
vain. As said a friend and biographer of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard: “If
it was God’s will thereby to deliver, not the bodies of many
eastern folk from the bondage of the heathen, but the souls
of many western folk from the bondage of sin, who shall
dare to ask why He has thus done?”<a id="Anchor_1044" href="#Footnote_1044" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1044.">[1044]</a> If the movement did
nothing for Palestine, it did something for England. Torn
and exhausted with her internal divisions, she could take no
part in it as a state; but nowhere was it more readily joined
by individual volunteers. The preaching of the Crusade was
a spark which kindled into flame, in the heart of more than
one of the troublers of the land, the smouldering embers of
a capacity for better things; it was a trumpet-call which
roused more than one brave knight to forsake the miserable
party-strife with which perhaps in his secret soul he had long
been growing disgusted, and fling into a better cause the
energies which he had been wasting upon his country’s ruin.<a id="Anchor_1045" href="#Footnote_1045" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1045.">[1045]</a>
But the movement did more for England than this. It
brought to light among the English people a spirit whose
existence at such a time could otherwise hardly have been
suspected. The one success of the Crusade was achieved by
a little independent squadron of one hundred and sixty-four
ships which sailed from Dartmouth on May 23, six days
before the feast of the Ascension, 1147. The expedition
consisted of Germans, Flemings and Englishmen, the latter
being the most numerous. Nearly all were men of low
degree; they had no commander-in-chief; each nationality
chose its own leader. The “men of the Empire”—a body
of Low-Germans who, for some unknown reason, chose to be
independent of the great Imperial host—followed Count
Arnold of Aerschot, who seems to have been the only person
of rank in the whole assemblage; the Flemings and the
men of Queen Matilda’s county of Boulogne were led by
Christian of Gistelles. The English grouped themselves
according to the districts of their birth under the guidance
of four marshals; Hervey of Glanville led the men of Norfolk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363">363</a></span>
and Suffolk; Simon of Dover<a id="Anchor_1046" href="#Footnote_1046" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1046.">[1046]</a> commanded the ships of
Kent; a man named Andrew was chief of the Londoners;
and a miscellaneous contingent from other parts of the
country was headed by Saher de Arcelles. The whole company
bound themselves by vows almost as stringent as those
of a religious order; they were pledged to eschew all fine
clothes and personal indulgences, and to help and avenge
one another in all things as sworn brethren; each ship had
its own chaplain and its regular services, as if it were a
parish; every man confessed and communicated once a week;
and for the enforcement of all these rules two men were
elected out of every thousand to form a body of sworn
judges<a id="Anchor_1047" href="#Footnote_1047" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1047.">[1047]</a> who should administer the common funds and assist
the marshals in maintaining order. These warrior-pilgrims,
sailing down the western coast of the Spanish peninsula on
their way to the Mediterranean Sea, touched at Oporto; at
the entreaty of the Portuguese King Alfonso and his people
they exchanged their intended crusade in Holy Land for one
which was perhaps more useful—a campaign for the deliverance
of Christian Portugal from its Moorish oppressors. The
Moors who occupied Lisbon were starved into surrender by
a four months’ blockade; the crusaders entered the city in
triumph; in the hour of temptation English discipline proved
strong enough to control German greed,<a id="Anchor_1048" href="#Footnote_1048" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1048.">[1048]</a> and renouncing all
share in the fruit of their victory these single-hearted soldiers
of the Cross made over the future capital of Portugal to its
Christian sovereign and went home rejoicing that they, a few
poor men of lowly birth and no reputation, had been counted
worthy to strike a successful blow for the Faith, while its
royal and imperial champions at the head of their countless
hosts met with nothing but disaster and disgrace.<a id="Anchor_1049" href="#Footnote_1049" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1049.">[1049]</a></p>

<p>There was no need to despair of a country whose middle
and lower classes could still produce men capable of an
exploit such as this. When a spontaneous gathering of poor
yeomen, common sailors and obscure citizens could reveal
such a spirit, it was plain that all England wanted to rescue
her from her misery was a competent leader. <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard,
watching over the fortunes of the English Church through
the eyes of his brethren at Fountains and Rievaux, had seen
this already; and he saw, too, that it was vain to look for
such a leader in either the king or the king-maker, Henry of
Winchester. Before the Church of England could rescue
the state, she must be freed from the political entanglements
into which she had been dragged by Henry’s impetuosity, and
enabled to resume a position of spiritual independence under
her rightful leader, the archbishop of Canterbury. With this
view the whole Cistercian order in England, supported and
directed by <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard, had set their faces against William
Fitz-Herbert’s appointment to the see of York, as an attempt
of king and legate to override the constitutional rights of
the southern primate and of the Church as a whole. “The
bishop of Winchester and the archbishop of York do not
walk in the same spirit with the archbishop of Canterbury,
but go their own way in opposition to him; and this comes
from the old quarrel about the legation”—thus Bernard
summed up the case.<a id="Anchor_1050" href="#Footnote_1050" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1050.">[1050]</a> Moreover the saving clause whereby
William of Durham was allowed to swear by proxy in behalf
of his namesake appears to have been interpolated by the
latter’s friends into the Papal decree; for “One William has
not sworn, yet the other is archbishop”<a id="Anchor_1051" href="#Footnote_1051" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1051.">[1051]</a> was the burthen of
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard’s cry to the Pope; and when in 1144 a cardinal-legate,
Hicmar, came to England with a pall for William of
York, he promised Bernard not to give it till he should have
received the oath from the bishop of Durham in person.<a id="Anchor_1052" href="#Footnote_1052" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1052.">[1052]</a></p>

<p>Neither prelate took any notice of Hicmar’s presence;
but when he was recalled by the death of Pope Lucius and
the accession of Eugene, the archbishop of York suddenly
perceived what a blunder he had made, and hurried to
Rome in quest of the pall about which he had hitherto
been so indifferent. Instead of giving it, Eugene suspended
him from all episcopal functions till such time as William
of Durham should have taken the oath required by the
sentence of Pope Innocent. The archbishop hereupon retired
to Sicily and took up his abode there with his fellow-countryman
the chancellor, Robert of Selby or Salisbury,<a id="Anchor_1053" href="#Footnote_1053" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1053.">[1053]</a>
under the protection of King Roger. As Roger was then at
bitter feud with the Church, this step was not likely to mend
William’s ecclesiastical reputation. His cause, bad from the
first and made worse by his own carelessness, was presently
ruined by his friends. The leaders of the opposition to him
in England were the abbots of Rievaux and Fountains; the
latter, Henry Murdac, was a native of Yorkshire who in
Archbishop Thurstan’s time had given up houses and lands,
home and kindred, to go out to Clairvaux at the call of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Bernard. In 1135 he was sent thence to found the abbey
of Vauclair;<a id="Anchor_1054" href="#Footnote_1054" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1054.">[1054]</a> in 1143 he was appointed to succeed Abbot
Richard <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> of Fountains, who had died at Clairvaux while
on his way to attend the general chapter of his order at
Cîteaux.<a id="Anchor_1055" href="#Footnote_1055" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1055.">[1055]</a> Henry Murdac went back to his native land
charged with an implied commission to make Fountains an
English Clairvaux and himself an English representative of
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard, and he fulfilled his charge with true Cistercian
zeal and fidelity.<a id="Anchor_1056" href="#Footnote_1056" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1056.">[1056]</a> As soon as William’s suspension became
known, his friends attributed it to the influence of Murdac,
whom they sought to punish by making an armed raid upon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366">366</a></span>
his abbey. Plunder, of course, they got little or none in a
freshly-reformed Cistercian house;<a id="Anchor_1057" href="#Footnote_1057" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1057.">[1057]</a> so, after a hurried and
unsuccessful search for Murdac himself, they set the place
on fire. Every stone of it perished except the church, which
escaped as by miracle; and the abbot escaped with it, for
he had been lying all the while, unnoticed by the passion-blinded
eyes of his foes, prostrate in prayer before the high
altar. The energy of the monks and the sympathy of their
neighbours soon enabled Fountains to rise from its ashes
more glorious than before;<a id="Anchor_1058" href="#Footnote_1058" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1058.">[1058]</a> but William’s day of grace was
at once brought to a close by this outrage. At a council
held in Paris in the spring of 1147, the abbot of Fountains
and a deputation from the chapter of York once more formally
presented to the Pope their charges against their
primate, and Eugene deposed William from his episcopal
office.<a id="Anchor_1059" href="#Footnote_1059" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1059.">[1059]</a> On the eve of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> James the chapter of York, with
the two suffragan bishops of the province—Durham and
Carlisle—met in obedience to a papal mandate for the
election of a new archbishop. The choice of the majority
fell upon Henry Murdac. From Clairvaux, whither he had
gone after the council, the abbot of Fountains was summoned
to the papal court at Trier, and there, on the octave of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Andrew, he received his consecration and his pall both at
once from Pope Eugene’s own hand.<a id="Anchor_1060" href="#Footnote_1060" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1060.">[1060]</a></p>

“<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hoc concilio</span>” ought, by all logical and grammatical

to antedate the council of Reims by a year. But Gervase himself says, almost

<p>The subsequent conduct of Stephen and Henry of Winchester
proved that their aim in securing the occupation of
the northern primacy had been rightly understood by Eugene
and Bernard. They had staked everything upon the success
of their scheme, and when it failed not only the king but
even the once cool and sagacious bishop completely lost his
head. Upon William himself the papal sentence had the
very opposite effect; it woke him from his dreams of easy
dignity and worldly pride; from that moment the idle,
showy, self-indulgent young ecclesiastic changed into an
humble saint, and when he came home next year it was not
to renew the strife but to turn away from the world and
possess his soul in patience.<a id="Anchor_1061" href="#Footnote_1061" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1061.">[1061]</a> But his uncles would not hear
of submission; Henry took him to live in his own house,
and there persisted in ostentatiously treating him with all
the honours due to the archbishop of York;<a id="Anchor_1062" href="#Footnote_1062" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1062.">[1062]</a> and when in
the summer of 1148 the new archbishop also came back to
England, Stephen demanded sworn security for his fidelity
before he would let him set foot in the country.<a id="Anchor_1063" href="#Footnote_1063" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1063.">[1063]</a> The
citizens of York, instigated by the treasurer of the see, Hugh
of Puiset, who like William was a nephew of the king, shut
their gates in their primate’s face; he withdrew to Ripon,
laid his diocese under interdict and excommunicated Hugh;
but Hugh, strong in the support of his uncles, defied the
interdict and was even impudent enough to return the excommunication.<a id="Anchor_1064" href="#Footnote_1064" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1064.">[1064]</a></p>

<p>In the southern province matters had come to a still
more dangerous crisis. Early in 1148 all the English
bishops were summoned by the Pope to a council which was
to meet at Reims on Mid-Lent Sunday. Three of them—Hereford,
Chichester and Norwich—were sent by Stephen
himself; but when the archbishop of Canterbury made the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_368">368</a></span>
usual application for leave to quit the country, the king
refused, set a watch at every port to stop his egress, and at
his brother Henry’s instigation swore that if Theobald did
go he should be banished on his return. Theobald however
had made up his mind to go at any cost; he slipped away
in an old broken boat with only two companions—Roger of
Pont-l’Evêque and Thomas of London, the latter of whom
had now been for several years the most trusted medium of
intercommunication between the primate and the court of
Rome. The daring voyagers reached their journey’s end in
safety, and Theobald was triumphantly presented to the
council by the Pope as one who had swum rather than
sailed across the Channel for the sake of his duty to the
Church.<a id="Anchor_1065" href="#Footnote_1065" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1065.">[1065]</a> The bishops who had failed to attend were all
suspended, Henry of Winchester being specially mentioned
by name. His brother, however,—the good count of Blois
who seems to have been at once the scapegoat and the
peacemaker for all the sins of his family, and who was held
in the deepest esteem by both Eugene and Bernard—made
intercession on his behalf, and obtained a relaxation of the
sentence against him on condition of his coming to Rome
within six months.<a id="Anchor_1066" href="#Footnote_1066" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1066.">[1066]</a> As for the king, Eugene would have
excommunicated him at once; but for him the other Theobald
stepped forward as mediator, like Anselm in a somewhat
similar case, and procured him a respite of three
months.<a id="Anchor_1067" href="#Footnote_1067" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1067.">[1067]</a> The intercessor’s reward was the threatened
sentence of banishment, issued as soon as he returned to
Canterbury. He withdrew into France and appealed to the
Pope, while Stephen seized the temporalities of the see and
began playing the part of the Red King on a small scale.
Eugene wrote to all the English bishops, severally and in a
body, bidding them summon the king to restore the primate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_369">369</a></span>
at once, lay all his dominions under interdict if he refused,
and tell him that he should certainly be excommunicated by
the Pope on Michaelmas day. The bishops however were all
on the court-side; the interdict, duly published by Theobald,
was unheeded save in his own diocese; and the king remained
obstinate.<a id="Anchor_1068" href="#Footnote_1068" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1068.">[1068]</a> But his wiser queen, aided by William
of Ypres, who, however he may have sinned against others,
was unquestionably Stephen’s truest friend, made an effort
to restore peace; and at their request Theobald removed to
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer, as being a more accessible place for negotiation
than his French retreat.<a id="Anchor_1069" href="#Footnote_1069" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1069.">[1069]</a></p>

<p>Matilda of Boulogne doubtless saw what Theobald must
have known full well, that the quarrel involved a great deal
more than strictly ecclesiastical questions. The issue which
the ordeal of battle had failed to decide was on its trial now
in a different form and before another tribunal. The most
curious symptom of this feeling, perhaps, was the action of
Brian Fitz-Count, who, after having been for years Matilda’s
most devoted and most successful champion in the field,
suddenly exchanged the sword for the pen and brought out
a defence of his Lady’s rights in the shape of a little treatise
which gained the approval of one of the cleverest men and
greatest scholars of the time, Gilbert Foliot, abbot of
Gloucester.<a id="Anchor_1070" href="#Footnote_1070" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1070.">[1070]</a> Geoffrey Plantagenet, with his Angevin quickness,
was the first openly to proclaim the true position of
affairs by sending to Stephen, through Bishop Miles of
Térouanne, a formal challenge to give up his ill-gotten realm
and submit to an investigation of his claims before the
papal court. Stephen retorted by a counter-challenge, calling
upon Geoffrey to give up his equally ill-gotten duchy
before he would agree to any further proceeding in the
matter.<a id="Anchor_1071" href="#Footnote_1071" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1071.">[1071]</a> Geoffrey took him at his word, but in a way
which he was far from desiring. He did give up the duchy
of Normandy, by making it over to his own son, Henry

<p>The crisis was now close at hand; Stephen was at last
face to face with his true rival. He appears to have consented,
as if in desperation, to the proposed trial at Rome.
It seems at first glance as if the envoys whom he sent to represent
him there must indeed have been driven to their wits’
end for an argument in his behalf when they raked up again a
scandal which <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Anselm had laid to rest half a century
ago, as to the validity of the marriage between Matilda’s
father and mother.<a id="Anchor_1073" href="#Footnote_1073" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1073.">[1073]</a> Yet such was the argument publicly
put forth by many voices against the legality of her claims
to the crown; and though one account of the proceedings
states that her adversaries were triumphantly confuted by
Bishop Ulger of Angers,<a id="Anchor_1074" href="#Footnote_1074" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1074.">[1074]</a> another, written by an eye-witness
whose own opinions were wholly in her favour, declares
that her advocates answered never a word.<a id="Anchor_1075" href="#Footnote_1075" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1075.">[1075]</a> The trial seems
to have ended without any decision;<a id="Anchor_1076" href="#Footnote_1076" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1076.">[1076]</a> it was however quickly
followed by a very significant event. The witness just
referred to was Gilbert Foliot, a Cluniac monk who since
1139 had been abbot of Gloucester, and whose reputation
for learning, wisdom and holiness had secured to him the
confidence of the primate and the consideration of all parties
alike in Church and state. He had reluctantly and after
some delay obeyed Theobald’s summons to join him at the
papal court; once there, he seems to have flung all his
energies into the organization of the new policy of which
Theobald was to be the leader.<a id="Anchor_1077" href="#Footnote_1077" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1077.">[1077]</a> During the session of the
council at Reims the bishop of Hereford died.<a id="Anchor_1078" href="#Footnote_1078" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1078.">[1078]</a> The Pope

September he was consecrated by Theobald at <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Omer,
with the consent and approval of the young duke of the
Normans, given on the express condition that he should
do homage for the temporalities of his see to the duke and
not to the king.</p>

<p>The very first thing Gilbert did was to break this
promise;<a id="Anchor_1080" href="#Footnote_1080" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1080.">[1080]</a> but that Theobald should have consecrated such
a man on such terms was a sign of the times which Stephen
could hardly fail to understand. Theobald himself soon
afterwards ventured back to England; crossing from Gravelines,
he landed at Gosford in the territories of Hugh Bigod,
by whom he was hospitably received; the bishops of London,
Chichester and Norwich, with several barons, came to meet
him at Hugh’s castle of Framlingham; the king was reconciled,
the primate restored, the interdict raised, and the
suspended prelates, all save one, allowed to resume their
functions.<a id="Anchor_1081" href="#Footnote_1081" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1081.">[1081]</a> The exception was Henry of Winchester, who
by neglecting to go to Rome within the prescribed six
months had necessarily fallen under the sentence pronounced
against him by Eugene at the council of Reims. Even to
him, however, Theobald was willing at Stephen’s request to
hold out the hand of fellowship and forgiveness.<a id="Anchor_1082" href="#Footnote_1082" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1082.">[1082]</a> But
Henry of Winchester’s days of king-making were over. It
was time for another Henry to appear upon the political
scene, to take his cause into his own hands and stand forth
as the champion of his own claims against the man who had
supplanted him on his grandfather’s throne.</p>

<span class="ch1">CHAPTER <abbr title="8">VIII.</abbr></span><br />

<span class="ch2">HENRY DUKE OF THE NORMANS.</span><br />

<span class="ch3">1149–1154.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">No</span> loving hands have done for the early life of Henry Fitz-Empress
what they did for that of his contemporary, his
friend, his opponent Thomas of London; we have no stories
of his boyhood, no picture of his home. Home indeed, in
the full sense of the word, he never had and never could
have. That instinctive attachment to one particular spot,
or at the least to one particular country, which is innate in
most men, was to a child of Geoffrey and Matilda simply
impossible. Geoffrey was the son of an Angevin count and
a Cenomannian countess; Matilda was the daughter of a
king born in England of a Norman father and a Flemish
mother, and of a queen whose parents were the one a
Scottish Celt, the other a West-Saxon with a touch of
High-German blood. In the temper of the Empress the
Norman element was undoubtedly the strongest; no trace
can be seen in her of the gentle spirit of her mother; and it
is clear that no lingering regrets for the land of her birth<a id="Anchor_1083" href="#Footnote_1083" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1083.">[1083]</a>
haunted the girl-bride of the Emperor in her palace at
Aachen as they haunted the monk Orderic, from boyhood
to old age, in his cell at Saint-Evroul. Yet when she came
to Normandy in her twenty-third year, she came there
unwillingly and as a complete stranger. If Henry was to
inherit any national or patriotic feeling at all, it could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_373">373</a></span>
be from his mother; what she transmitted to him instead
was a sort of cosmopolitanism which saved the future duke
of Normandy and king of England from the too exclusive
influence of the demon-blood of Anjou, not by making
him a Norman, still less an Englishman, but by rendering
his nationality a yet more insoluble problem than her own.
Even in his father, too, there are signs of a divided national
sentiment. The son of Aremburg of Maine, the grandson
and heir of Elias, could not cling to the black rock of
Angers with the exclusive attachment of its earlier counts;
a share of his patriotic affection and pride must have been
given to that other, red rock above the Sarthe which had
held out so long and so bravely against both Normandy and
Anjou, to that Cenomannian land of heroes which Norman
and Angevin alike had counted it their highest glory to
overcome and win. It may have been by chance, or it
may have been of set purpose, that Geoffrey and Matilda
were at Le Mans when their first child was born; no other
spot could have been half so appropriate. The land which
Normans and Angevins and even Englishmen<a id="Anchor_1084" href="#Footnote_1084" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1084.">[1084]</a> had done
their utmost to wipe out of the list of states, the land whose
claim to a separate existence, ignored or denied by them all,
had yet proved the insurmountable stumbling-block which
forced them into union<span class="nobreak">:—</span>that land was the most fitting
birth-place for the child who was to be neither Norman, nor
Angevin, nor English, and yet was to be all three at once.
The vengeance of Maine upon her conquerors formed a
characteristic close to her national career. They had
swallowed her up at last; but they had no sooner done
it than she gave a master to them all.</p>

<p>If, then, Normandy, England and Anjou had each a part
in Henry, Le Mans had two parts, as being at once the home
of his father’s mother and the scene of his own birth. His
earliest recollections, however, must rather have been associated
with Normandy. His first journey thither was made
when he was about twelve months old, when he accompanied
his mother on a visit to King Henry in the spring 1134.
His brother Geoffrey was born at Argentan on June 1, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374">374</a></span>
the two children narrowly escaped being left motherless under
their grandfather’s care.<a id="Anchor_1085" href="#Footnote_1085" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1085.">[1085]</a> Possibly this made them all the
dearer to him; he certainly found in them his last earthly
pleasure, of which he was finally deprived by a quarrel with
their mother, who seems to have sent them back to Angers
shortly before her own return thither in the autumn of 1135.<a id="Anchor_1086" href="#Footnote_1086" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1086.">[1086]</a>
For the next seven years little Henry can have seen nothing
of his future duchy; and we have no means of knowing
whether its stately capital, its people, its dialect, had left any
impression upon him, or whether any dim personal remembrance
was associated in his mind with that name of “my
grandfather King Henry” to which he appealed so constantly
in later life. His training, after his return to Angers
as before, must have devolved chiefly upon Matilda; for
Geoffrey during the next three years was too busy with
unsuccessful fighting abroad in the interest of his wife and
son to have much leisure for devoting himself to their society
at home. It was not till the close of 1138 that his influence
can have been seriously brought to bear upon his
children, of whom there were now three, another son, named
William, having been born in August 1136.<a id="Anchor_1087" href="#Footnote_1087" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1087.">[1087]</a> After the
disaster of Toucques the count appears to have spent his
time until the beginning of 1141 for the most part quietly
at home, where his wife’s departure over sea left him in his
turn sole guardian of his boys. In one respect at least he
did not neglect his paternal duty. “Unlettered king, crowned
ass,” was a reproach which would have fallen with double
disgrace upon the son of Geoffrey Plantagenet and the
grandson of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>; and Geoffrey took care that his firstborn
should never be exposed to it. It may even be that
in those two years when war and politics left him at leisure
for the quieter enjoyments of his books, his hunting and his
home, the young father himself took up the task, of which he
was certainly quite capable, of instilling into his child the
first rudiments of that book-learning which he loved so well.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_375">375</a></span>
At any rate, it was he who chose the first teacher to whom
Henry’s education was intrusted. As if on purpose to add
one more to the varied influences already working in that
young mind, the teacher was neither Angevin, nor Cenomannian,
nor Norman. He was one Master Peter of Saintes,
“learned above all his contemporaries in the science of
verse.”<a id="Anchor_1088" href="#Footnote_1088" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1088.">[1088]</a></p>

<p>Under Peter’s care the boy remained till the close of
1142, when, as we have seen, he was sent to England in
company with his uncle Robert of Gloucester. Henry now
entered upon a third phase of education. For the next
four years his uncle took charge of him and kept him in his
own household at Bristol under the care of one Master Matthew,
by whom he was to be “imbued with letters and instructed
in good manners, as beseemed a youth of his rank.”<a id="Anchor_1089" href="#Footnote_1089" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1089.">[1089]</a> This
arrangement may have been due to the Empress, or it may
have originated with Geoffrey when he sent the boy over
sea in the earl’s company; for much as they differed in
other matters, on the subject of a boy’s training the two
brothers-in-law could hardly fail to be of the same mind. A
well-balanced compound of soldier, statesman and scholar
was Earl Robert’s ideal no less than Count Geoffrey’s; an
ideal so realized in his own person that he might safely be
trusted to watch over its developement in the person of his
little nephew. As far as the military element was concerned,
the earl of Gloucester, with his matured experience and
oft-proved valour, was no less capable than the count of
Anjou of furnishing a model of all knightly prowess, skill
and courtesy; and if Henry’s chivalry was to be tempered
with discretion—if it was to be regulated by a wise and
wary policy—if he was to acquire any insight into the
principles of sound and prudent state-craft—Robert was
certainly, among the group of adventurers who surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_376">376</a></span>
the Empress, the only man from whom he could learn anything
of the kind. The boy was indeed scarce ten years
old, and even for the heir of Anjou and England it was
perhaps somewhat too early to begin such studies as these.
For the literary side of his education, later years proved that
Robert’s choice of a teacher was as good as Geoffrey’s had
been; the seed sowed by Peter of Saintes was well watered
by Matthew, and it seems to have brought forth in his young
pupil’s mind a harvest of gratitude as well as of learning,
for among the chancellors of King Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> there appears
a certain “Master Matthew” who can hardly be any other
than his old teacher.<a id="Anchor_1090" href="#Footnote_1090" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1090.">[1090]</a></p>

<p>To teach the boy “good manners”—in the true sense
of those words—must have been a somewhat difficult task
amid his present surroundings. Bristol, during the years of
Henry’s residence there, fully kept up its character as the
“stepmother of all England”; he must have been continually
seeing or hearing of bands of soldiers issuing from the castle
to ravage and plunder, burn and slay, or troops of captives
dragged in to linger in its dungeons till they had given up
their uttermost farthing or were set free by a miserable death.
It seems likely, however, that the worst of these horrors
occurred during Robert’s absence and without his sanction,
for even the special panegyrist of Stephen gives the earl
credit for doing his utmost to maintain order and justice in
the shires over which he ruled.<a id="Anchor_1091" href="#Footnote_1091" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1091.">[1091]</a> It was not his fault if
matters had drifted into such a state that his efforts were
worse than useless; and his good intentions were at any rate
not more ineffectual than those of the king. Within the
domestic circle itself it is not unlikely that the child was
better placed under the influence of Robert and Mabel than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_377">377</a></span>
either in the household of his violent-tempered mother or in
that of his refined but selfish father, whom he rejoined in the
spring of 1147, a year before the return of the Empress.
He was in his sixteenth year when Geoffrey ceded to him
the duchy of Normandy. A boy of that age, especially in
the house of Anjou, was counted a man, and expected to act
as such. The cession was in fact intended and understood
as a solemn proclamation both to friends and foes that
henceforth they would have to deal with King Henry’s
chosen heir no longer indirectly, but in his own person; that
his rights were to be vindicated in future not by his parents
but by himself.</p>

<p>He lost no time in beginning his work. In the middle
of May 1149 Stephen, while endeavouring to put down a
fresh revolt of the earls of Chester and Pembroke,<a id="Anchor_1092" href="#Footnote_1092" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1092.">[1092]</a> was
startled by news of Henry’s arrival in England. The
young duke of the Normans landed we know not where,
and made his way northward, recruiting a few of his mother’s
old adherents as he went: his great-uncle King David
welcomed him at Carlisle, and there knighted him on Whit-Sunday.<a id="Anchor_1093" href="#Footnote_1093" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1093.">[1093]</a>
Stephen evidently took this act as a challenge,
for he immediately retorted by knighting his eldest son
Eustace, thus pointedly setting up his own heir as a rival
to his young kinsman.<a id="Anchor_1094" href="#Footnote_1094" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1094.">[1094]</a> He then hastened with all his
forces to York, but no hostilities took place.<a id="Anchor_1095" href="#Footnote_1095" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1095.">[1095]</a> The intended

evenly balanced to be turned by the mere weight of his
maiden sword; and his work was being done for him,
better than he could do it himself, by clerk and primate,
abbot and Pope—most surely of all, by the blundering king
himself.</p>

The writer of
    <cite><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gesta <abbr title="Stephani">Steph.</abbr></i> (<abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> 128, 129)</cite>
has a most romantic account of Henry’s adventures.
Henry, he says, came over with a very small force, and nothing to pay them with
except promises. He made an attempt upon Bourton and Cricklade, and was
repulsed; whereupon his troops all fell away and left him so helpless that he was
obliged to ask his mother for some money. She had none to give him; he then
asked his uncle Gloucester, but the latter, “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">suis sacculis avide incumbens</span>,” refused.
Then Henry in desperation appealed to the king, beseeching his compassion for
the sake of their kindred blood; and Stephen at once sent him the needful sum.
The trait is just what might be expected in Stephen; but it is hard to conceive
Henry ever getting into such a plight; and the mention of Robert of Gloucester
as still alive shews there must be something wrong in the story.

one of David’s granddaughters for his son; he promised on these conditions to

<p>A double chain connected English politics with those of
the Roman court. The links of the one chain were <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Bernard and Henry Murdac; those of the other were Theobald
of Canterbury and Thomas of London. What was the
exact nature of those communications between the primate
and the Pope of which Thomas was the medium—how
much of the credit of Theobald’s policy is due to himself
and how much to his confidential instrument and adviser—we
have no means of determining precisely. The aim of
that policy was to consolidate the forces of the English
Church by deepening her intercourse and strengthening her
connexion with the sister-Churches of the West, and thus
bring the highest religious and political influences of Latin
Christendom to bear upon the troubles of the English state.
The way had been paved by Henry of Winchester in his
legatine days. He and the councils which he convened had
first suggested the possibility of finding a remedy for the
lack of secular administration in an appeal to the authority
of the canon law, now formulated as a definite code by the
labours of a Bolognese lawyer, Gratian. The very strifes
and jealousies which arose from Henry’s over-vigorous
assertion of his authority tended to a like result; they led<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_379">379</a></span>
to more frequent appeals to Rome, to elaborate legal pleadings,
to the drawing of subtle legal distinctions unknown to
the old customary procedure of the land; as a contemporary
writer expresses it, “Then were laws and lawyers first brought
into England.”<a id="Anchor_1099" href="#Footnote_1099" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1099.">[1099]</a> On the Continent the study of the civil
jurisprudence of the Roman Empire had been revived together
with that of the canon law; some members of Archbishop
Theobald’s household resolved to introduce it into
England, hoping thereby, as it seems, to sow amid the
general confusion some seeds of a more orderly and law-abiding
spirit. During the time of comparative quiet which
intervened between his first journey to Rome in 1143 and
his expedition with Theobald to the council of Reims in
1148, Thomas of London had spent a year at Bologna and
Auxerre to perfect himself in the literary culture which he
had somewhat neglected in his youth.<a id="Anchor_1100" href="#Footnote_1100" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1100.">[1100]</a> The university of
Bologna was the chief seat of the new legal learning; it
may therefore have been through Thomas that a Lombard
teacher, Vacarius, was induced to visit England in 1149
and open lectures at Oxford on the Roman law.<a id="Anchor_1101" href="#Footnote_1101" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1101.">[1101]</a> Rich
and poor flocked to hear him, and at the request of his
poorer scholars he made an abridgement of the Code and
Digests, sufficient for practical use, and more within reach
of their scanty means than the heavy folios of Justinian.<a id="Anchor_1102" href="#Footnote_1102" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1102.">[1102]</a>
His lectures however were summarily brought to an end by
order of the king; Stephen, scared by young Duke Henry’s
presence in the north, jealous of the primate, jealous of the
Church, jealous of everything in which he saw or thought he
saw the least token of an influence which might be used
against himself, at once silenced the teacher and ordered the
students to give up their books. He gained as little as is
usually gained by such a mode of proceeding in such cases.
The study of the civil law only spread and prospered the
more for his efforts to hinder it;<a id="Anchor_1103" href="#Footnote_1103" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1103.">[1103]</a> and the law-school<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_380">380</a></span>
of the future university of Oxford may have sprung
from a germ left in the cloisters of Oseney or <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Frideswide’s by the brief visit of the Lombard master,
just as the divinity-school may have sprung from a germ
left there sixteen years before by the lectures of Robert
Pulein.</p>

<p>Stephen had struck at the southern primate indirectly
this time; with the northern one he was still at open feud.
One use which he made of his stay in Yorkshire was to
exact a heavy fine from the inhabitants of Beverley, as a
punishment for having given shelter to Henry Murdac.
After the king’s departure the archbishop at last succeeded
in enforcing his interdict at York; Eustace hurried thither,
insisted upon the restoration of the services, and drove out
all who refused to take part in them; there was a great
tumult, in which the senior archdeacon was killed by the
followers of the king’s son.<a id="Anchor_1104" href="#Footnote_1104" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1104.">[1104]</a> About the same time a
cardinal-legate, John Paparo, on his way to Ireland, asked
for a safe-conduct through the dominions of the English
king; Stephen refused to give it unless he would promise
to do nothing on his journey to the prejudice of the English
realm. John went home highly indignant at such an insinuation
against his honour and that of the Apostolic See.<a id="Anchor_1105" href="#Footnote_1105" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1105.">[1105]</a>
Meanwhile Archbishop Murdac was writing bitter complaints
both to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard and to the Pope. They apparently
determined to give Stephen a warning which even he could
not fail to understand; and they did it by sending a commission
as resident legate <i>a latere</i> for all Britain to the
archbishop of Canterbury.<a id="Anchor_1106" href="#Footnote_1106" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1106.">[1106]</a></p>

<p>The warning took effect; Stephen changed his policy at
once. He was weary of all his fruitless labour; his chief<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_381">381</a></span>
anxiety now was to secure the crown to his son; and he
suddenly awoke to the necessity of setting himself right with
the one power which alone could enable him to carry out
his desire. Eustace himself was sent to act as mediator between
his father and Henry Murdac; a reconciliation took
place, and the archbishop was enthroned at York on <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Paul’s day 1151. Thence he went to keep Easter with
the Pope, having undertaken, at Stephen’s request, to intercede
for him with Eugene concerning the state of politics in
England, and especially to obtain, if possible, the papal
sanction to a formal acknowledgement of Eustace as heir to
the crown.<a id="Anchor_1107" href="#Footnote_1107" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1107.">[1107]</a> The southern primate meanwhile was beginning
his legatine career with a Mid-Lenten council in London, at
which Stephen, Eustace, and the principal barons of England
were present. The main feature of this council was a crowd
of appeals to Rome, whereof three were made by the bishop
of Winchester.<a id="Anchor_1108" href="#Footnote_1108" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1108.">[1108]</a> One of these appeals must have been
against the suspension to which he had been sentenced at
the council of Reims, and by which the Pope, less placable
than the primate, still held him bound. Moreover, complaints
against him were pouring into Rome from all quarters;
so he carried his appeals in person, and went to clear himself
before the supreme pontiff. He succeeded in obtaining
absolution;<a id="Anchor_1109" href="#Footnote_1109" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1109.">[1109]</a> his friends, of whom there were still many at
the papal court, tried hard to win for him something more—either
a renewal of the legation, or the accomplishment
of his old scheme of a primacy over Wessex, or at least the
exemption of his own see from the jurisdiction of Canterbury;
but Eugene was inexorable. He believed that
Stephen’s misconduct towards the Church was instigated
by his brother; a very natural view, but somewhat unjust
to the bishop.<a id="Anchor_1110" href="#Footnote_1110" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1110.">[1110]</a> The truth seems rather to be that Henry,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_382">382</a></span>
after vainly trying to rule the storm, had for awhile been
swept away by its violence. Now he had emerged into the
calm once more; and there henceforth he was content to
remain. He consoled himself for the failure of his political
hopes with a choice collection of antique statues purchased
in Rome for the adornment of his palace at Winchester,
and sailed quietly home with these treasures, stopping on
his way to pay his devotions at the shrine of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> James at
Compostella.<a id="Anchor_1111" href="#Footnote_1111" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1111.">[1111]</a> At his request the Pope ordered Archbishop
Murdac to absolve Hugh of Puiset, who was making himself
useful at Winchester, not on clerical duty, but in taking
charge of the bishop’s castles during his absence.<a id="Anchor_1112" href="#Footnote_1112" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1112.">[1112]</a> With
Hugh’s absolution the schism in the northern province
came to an end, and the English Church was once again
reunited.</p>

<p>For England and for Stephen alike the prospect seemed
to be brightening. Stephen however was clearly beginning
to feel that for him as well as for his Angevin rivals it was
time to give place to a younger generation. It must have
been chiefly for Eustace’s sake that he valued his crown;
and in Eustace’s case, as in that of Henry Fitz-Empress,
there were many circumstances which might make the pretensions
of the child more generally acceptable than those
of the parent. Eustace seems to have been about the same
age as Henry, or probably a few years older; he was free
from the personal obloquy and suspicion attaching to
Stephen from the errors of the past; on the other hand,
as the son of Matilda of Boulogne, he might reap the benefit
of his mother’s well-earned personal popularity, as well as of
her descent from the royal house of Wessex. Henceforth,
therefore, Stephen showed a disposition to treat Henry Fitz-Empress
as the rival less of himself than of his son, and to
follow up every movement in Henry’s public life by a
parallel step in the career of Eustace. And as Henry’s
first independent act had been a sort of reconnoitring expedition<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_383">383</a></span>
to England, so the first retaliation was a visit made
by Eustace to the king of France, with a view to ascertain
his chances of support in an attempt to regain Normandy.</p>

<p>The existing phase of the rivalry between the houses of
Anjou and Blois—their struggle for the dominion of Normandy
and England—was a matter which concerned the
interests of the French Crown almost as deeply as the earlier
phase in which Fulk the Black and Odo of Champagne
strove with each other for political mastery over their common
lord paramount. Neither the accumulation of England,
Normandy, Maine, Anjou and Touraine in a single hand,
nor the acquisition of Normandy and England by a branch
of the mighty and troublesome house which already held
Blois, Chartres and Champagne, could be viewed by the
French king without grave uneasiness. Either alternative
had its dangers; to Louis <abbr title="7">VII.</abbr>, however, the danger would
appear much less threatening than to his father. Shortly
before the dying Louis <abbr title="6">VI.</abbr> granted the investiture of Normandy
to Stephen’s little son in 1137, the last of the old
line of the dukes of Aquitaine—William <abbr title="the Ninth">IX.</abbr>, son of the
gay crusader and troubadour whom the Red King had
hoped to succeed—died on a pilgrimage at Compostella.<a id="Anchor_1113" href="#Footnote_1113" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1113.">[1113]</a>
His only son was already dead, and before setting out for
his pilgrimage he did what a greater personage had done
ten years before: with the consent of his barons, he left
the whole of his dominions to his daughter. Moreover,
he bequeathed the girl herself as wife to the young King
Louis of France.<a id="Anchor_1114" href="#Footnote_1114" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1114.">[1114]</a> This marriage more than doubled the
strength of the French Crown. It gave to Louis absolute
possession of all western Aquitaine, or Guyenne as it was
now beginning to be called; that is, the counties of Poitou
and Gascony, with the immediate overlordship of the whole
district lying between the Loire and the Pyrenees, the
Rhône and the ocean<span class="nobreak">:—</span>a territory five or six times as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_384">384</a></span>
large as his own royal domain, and over which his predecessors
had never been able to assert more than the merest
shadow of a nominal superiority.<a id="Anchor_1115" href="#Footnote_1115" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1115.">[1115]</a> To a man who was at
once king of France and duke of Aquitaine it was comparatively
no great matter whether the dominions of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>
were to be annexed to those of Geoffrey of Anjou or allied
to those of Theobald of Blois. The truest interest of France,
however, obviously was that England and Normandy should
be divided, one of them being held by each of the two competitors;
and it was doubtless with this view that Louis,
while sanctioning and aiding Geoffrey’s conquest of the
Norman duchy, still kept on peaceful terms with the English
king, and held to a promise of marriage made some years
before between his own sister and Stephen’s son Eustace.<a id="Anchor_1116" href="#Footnote_1116" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1116.">[1116]</a></p>

Perhaps the most striking indication of the importance of the duke of Aquitaine
is the ceremony of the ducal crowning, which Louis, as husband of the

<p>At the time of Geoffrey’s final success Louis was at
deadly strife with the count of Blois; a strife in which the
king was wholly in the wrong, and for whose disastrous consequences
he afterwards grieved so deeply that his penitence
was the chief motive which induced him to go on crusade.<a id="Anchor_1117" href="#Footnote_1117" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1117.">[1117]</a>
Since then, Geoffrey in his turn had incurred the royal displeasure.
There was a certain Gerald, lord of a castle called
Montreuil-Bellay, near the southern border of Anjou—one
of the fortresses raised by the great castle-builder Fulk Nerra
in the earliest days of his warfare with Odo of Blois—whom
an Angevin chronicler describes as an absolute monster of
wickedness,<a id="Anchor_1118" href="#Footnote_1118" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1118.">[1118]</a> but who had so won the favour of the king that
he made him seneschal of Poitou. In 1147 this Gerald was
the ring-leader of a fresh revolt of the Angevin barons
against their count. The revolt was as usual soon put
down: but it was not so easy to punish Gerald; for Montreuil<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385">385</a></span>
was an almost impregnable fortress, with a keep of
great strength and height, “lifting itself up to the stars,”
surrounded by a double wall and rampart, and further protected
by an encircling chasm, very deep and precipitous,
which was called the “Valley of Judas,” and prevented any
engines of war from coming within range of the castle.<a id="Anchor_1119" href="#Footnote_1119" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1119.">[1119]</a>
Some time in 1148 Geoffrey built three towers of stone in
the neighbourhood of Montreuil, as a base for future operations
against it.<a id="Anchor_1120" href="#Footnote_1120" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1120.">[1120]</a> In the summer of 1150 an outrage committed
by Gerald upon the abbot and monks of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Aubin at
Angers brought matters to a crisis;<a id="Anchor_1121" href="#Footnote_1121" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1121.">[1121]</a> Geoffrey made the
monks’ quarrel his own and at once set his engineers to
level the ground all around Montreuil, in preparation for
bringing up his machines to the assault. After nearly
twelve months’ labour,<a id="Anchor_1122" href="#Footnote_1122" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1122.">[1122]</a> however, the “Judas-Valley” still
yawned between himself and his foes, till he ordered the
annual fair usually held at Saumur to be transferred to Montreuil.
In a fortnight the energies of the crowd who flocked
to the fair, joined to those of his own soldiers, filled up the
valley and made it into level ground.<a id="Anchor_1123" href="#Footnote_1123" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1123.">[1123]</a> Geoffrey could now
bring his engines within range, and he used them with such
effect that at the first assault the outworks were destroyed
and the garrison driven to take refuge in the keep. A summons
to surrender was, however, scornfully rejected by
Gerald, trusting in the strength of his tower and the expected
help of the king.<a id="Anchor_1124" href="#Footnote_1124" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1124.">[1124]</a></p>

<p>For Louis had now returned from Palestine;<a id="Anchor_1125" href="#Footnote_1125" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1125.">[1125]</a> and so
great was his wrath at Geoffrey’s treatment of his favourite
that he consented to join Eustace in an attack upon the
Norman duchy. Its defence was left to its young duke,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386">386</a></span>
then busy with the siege of Torigni on the Vire, held against
him by his cousin Richard Fitz-Count—a son of Earl
Robert of Gloucester.<a id="Anchor_1126" href="#Footnote_1126" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1126.">[1126]</a> Louis and Eustace marched upon
Arques; Henry led a force of Normans, Angevins and
Bretons to meet them; but his “older and wiser” barons
averted a battle,<a id="Anchor_1127" href="#Footnote_1127" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1127.">[1127]</a> and nothing more came of the expedition.
Geoffrey had never stirred from his camp before Montreuil.
Despite a formidable array of engines,<a id="Anchor_1128" href="#Footnote_1128" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1128.">[1128]</a> he made little progress;
every breach made in the walls by day was mended
by night with oaken beams, of which the besieged seemed
to have a never-ending supply. Geoffrey was characteristically
taking counsel with his books as to the best method of
overcoming this difficulty when some monks of Marmoutier
came to him on an errand for their convent. One of them
took up the book which the count laid down—
    <cite>the treatise
of Vegetius Renatus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Re Militari</i></cite>,
then, and long after,
the standard work on military engineering. It may have
been some memory of bygone days when he, too, had worn
helm and hauberk instead of cowl and scapulary that brought
into the monk’s eyes a gleam which made Geoffrey exclaim,
“Stay with me till to-morrow, good brother, and what you
are now reading shall be put in action before you.” Next
day a large red-hot iron vessel filled with boiling oil was
launched from the beam of a mangonel against one of the
timber insertions in the wall, and its bursting set the whole
place on fire.<a id="Anchor_1129" href="#Footnote_1129" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1129.">[1129]</a> Gerald, his spirit broken at last, came forth
with his family and his garrison “like serpents crawling out
of a cave,” as a hostile chronicler says,<a id="Anchor_1130" href="#Footnote_1130" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1130.">[1130]</a> and surrendered to
the mercy of the count, who sent him to prison at Angers.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387">387</a></span>
The keep was razed at once, save one fragment of wall, left
by Geoffrey, and still standing at this hour, as a memorial of
his victory and of the skill and perseverance by which it had
been won.<a id="Anchor_1131" href="#Footnote_1131" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1131.">[1131]</a></p>

<p>The count of Anjou now moved northward to help his
son against the king. By the help of a brother of his old
ally William Talvas he gained possession of La Nue, a
castle belonging to the king’s brother Count Robert of
Dreux.<a id="Anchor_1132" href="#Footnote_1132" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1132.">[1132]</a> Louis and Robert avenged themselves by burning
the town of Séez. Presently after, in August, Louis
gathered together all his forces and brought them down the
Seine to a spot between Meulan and Mantes. Geoffrey and
Henry collected an opposing army on their side of the
Norman border; but an attack of fever detained the king in
Paris, and a truce was made until he should recover.<a id="Anchor_1133" href="#Footnote_1133" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1133.">[1133]</a> The
ostensible ground of the dispute was Geoffrey’s treatment of
Gerald of Montreuil, which certainly seems to have been
unjustly cruel. Not content with receiving his unconditional
surrender, razing his castle, and forcing him to
make full atonement to the injured monks of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Aubin,
Geoffrey still persisted in keeping in prison not only Gerald
himself but also his whole family. The Pope anathematized
him for his unchristianlike severity;<a id="Anchor_1134" href="#Footnote_1134" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1134.">[1134]</a> but anathemas usually
fell powerless upon an Angevin count. Geoffrey was in
truth visiting upon Gerald his wrath at the double-dealing
of Gerald’s royal master; for he was well aware that King
Louis’s interference was prompted by far other motives than
disinterested sympathy for his seneschal. Louis was, according
to his wont, playing fast and loose with the rival claimants
of Normandy, in such shameless fashion that his own
chief minister, Suger, had been the first to reprove him in
strong terms for his unwarrantable attack upon the Angevins,
had stood firmly by Geoffrey all through the struggle, and
was now endeavouring, through the mediation of the count
of Vermandois and the bishop of Lisieux, to baffle the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388">388</a></span>
schemes of Eustace and his party and bring the king back
to his old alliance with Anjou.<a id="Anchor_1135" href="#Footnote_1135" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1135.">[1135]</a></p>

<p>As soon as Louis was sufficiently recovered a meeting
was held in Paris to discuss the possibility of a settlement,
and the cause of peace was pleaded by no less an advocate
than <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard in person. But, almost for the first time,
Bernard pleaded in vain; Geoffrey started up in the midst
of the colloquy, and without a word of salutation to any one,
sprang upon his horse and rode away. The assembly broke
up in despair, and Gerald, who had been brought to hear its
result, threw himself at the feet of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard to implore a
last benediction before returning, as he thought, to lifelong
captivity. “Fear not,” replied the saint, “deliverance is
nearer than you think.” Scarcely had the prisoner turned
away when his jailer reappeared.<a id="Anchor_1136" href="#Footnote_1136" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1136.">[1136]</a> Geoffrey during his solitary
ride had revolved the political situation in his mind and
perceived that for his son’s sake he must make peace with
the king. Matters in England had reached such a crisis
that it was absolutely necessary to secure Henry’s tenure of
Normandy, as he might at any moment be required to go
beyond sea. To that end Geoffrey did more than give up
his personal vengeance upon Gerald of Montreuil; he persuaded
Henry to give up the Norman Vexin—the land between
the Epte and the Andelle, so long the battle-ground
of France and Normandy—to the king of France, in exchange
for the investiture of the rest of the duchy. If we
may believe the French chroniclers, the young duke made
a yet further sacrifice and became the “liegeman” of the
king—a form of homage to which none of his predecessors
had ever stooped.<a id="Anchor_1137" href="#Footnote_1137" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1137.">[1137]</a> Of the homage in some shape or other
there is however no doubt;<a id="Anchor_1138" href="#Footnote_1138" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1138.">[1138]</a> and it appears that the same
opportunity was taken to secure for Henry, without waiting<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389">389</a></span>
for his father’s death, the investiture of his father’s own
dominions.<a id="Anchor_1139" href="#Footnote_1139" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1139.">[1139]</a></p>

<p>Geoffrey was but just entering his thirty-ninth year, and
one can hardly help speculating for a moment as to his
plans for his own future. For him, now that his work in
the west was done, there was no such brilliant opening in
the east as there had been for Fulk <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr> when he, too, in the
prime of manhood, had chosen to make way for a younger
generation. But Geoffrey had begun public life at an earlier
age than either his father or his son; and he seems to have
had neither the moral nor the physical strength which had
enabled one Angevin count to carry on for half a century,
without break and without slackening, the work upon which
he had entered before he was fifteen, and to die in harness
at the very crowning-point of his activity and his success.
Geoffrey Plantagenet was no Fulk Nerra; he was not even
a Fulk of Jerusalem; and he may well have been weary of
a political career which must always have been embittered
by a feeling that he was the mere representative of others,
labouring not for himself, hardly even for his country or his
race, but only that the one might be swallowed up in the
vast dominions and the other merged in the royal line of his
ancestors’ Norman foe. He may have seriously intended to
pass the rest of his days among his books; or he may have
felt an inner warning that those days were to be very few.
With a perversity which may after all have been partly the
effect of secretly failing health, although he had now set
Gerald at liberty he still refused to acknowledge that he had
treated him with unjust severity, or to seek absolution from
the Pope’s censure; and he even answered with blasphemous
words to the gentle remonstrances of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard.
“With what measure thou hast meted it shall be meted to
thee again” said the saint at last as he turned away; one
of his followers, more impetuous, boldly prophesied that
Geoffrey would die within a year. He did die within a fortnight.<a id="Anchor_1140" href="#Footnote_1140" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1140.">[1140]</a>
On his way home from the king’s court,<a id="Anchor_1141" href="#Footnote_1141" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1141.">[1141]</a> overcome<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390">390</a></span>
with the heat, he plunged into a river to cool himself;<a id="Anchor_1142" href="#Footnote_1142" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1142.">[1142]</a> a
fever was the consequence; he was borne to Château-du-Loir,
and there on September 7 he passed away.<a id="Anchor_1143" href="#Footnote_1143" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1143.">[1143]</a> His
last legacy to his son was a piece of good advice, given
almost with his dying breath<span class="nobreak">:—</span>not to change the old customs
of the lands over which he was called to rule, whether
by bringing those of Normandy and England into Anjou, or
by seeking to transfer those of the Angevin dominions into
the territories which he inherited from his mother.<a id="Anchor_1144" href="#Footnote_1144" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1144.">[1144]</a> Dying
in the little border-fortress whence his grandfather Elias
had gone forth to liberate Maine, Geoffrey was buried, by
his own desire, not among his Angevin forefathers at Tours
or at Angers, but in his mother’s home at Le Mans.<a id="Anchor_1145" href="#Footnote_1145" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1145.">[1145]</a> A
splendid tomb, bearing his effigy adorned with gold and
gems, was raised over his remains in the cathedral church,<a id="Anchor_1146" href="#Footnote_1146" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1146.">[1146]</a>
whence it has disappeared to become a mere antiquarian
curiosity in a museum. Geoffrey’s sole surviving monument
is the one which he made for himself—the ruined, blackened
fragment of his great ancestor’s keep at Montreuil.</p>

<p>Stephen could not do what Geoffrey had done. His
kingdom was no mere fief to be passed from hand to hand
by a formal ceremony of surrender and investiture; the
crowned and anointed king of England could not so easily
abdicate in favour of his son. He might however do something
to counterbalance Henry’s advancement by obtaining
a public recognition of Eustace as his heir. In Lent 1152,
therefore, he summoned a great council in London, at which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391">391</a></span>
all the earls and barons swore fealty to Eustace.<a id="Anchor_1147" href="#Footnote_1147" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1147.">[1147]</a> Still the
king felt that his object was far from being secured. He
himself was a living proof how slight was the worth of such
an oath when the sovereign who had exacted it was gone.
There was, however, one further step possible, a step without
precedent in England, but one which the kings of France
had taken with complete success for several generations past:
the solemn coronation and unction of the heir to the throne
during his father’s lifetime. It was at this that Stephen had
aimed when he sent Archbishop Henry of York to Rome.
He took an unusually wise as well as a characteristically
generous measure in intrusting his cause to a reconciled
enemy; nevertheless the attempt failed. Pope Eugene by
his letters absolutely forbade the primate to make Eustace
king; therefore, when Stephen called upon Theobald and
the other bishops to anoint and crown the youth, they one
and all refused. Father and son were both equally vexed
and angry. They shut up all the bishops in one house and
tried to tease them into submission. A few, remembering
that “King Stephen never had loved clerks,” and that it
was not the first time he had cast bishops into prison,<a id="Anchor_1148" href="#Footnote_1148" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1148.">[1148]</a> were
so frightened that they gave way; the majority stood firm,
and the primate himself escaped down the Thames in a fishing-boat,
made his way to Dover, and thence retreated beyond
sea.<a id="Anchor_1149" href="#Footnote_1149" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1149.">[1149]</a> Without him there was nothing to be done, and
of his yielding there was no chance whatever; for close at
his side stood the real fount and source of the papal opposition—Thomas
of London.<a id="Anchor_1150" href="#Footnote_1150" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1150.">[1150]</a></p>

<p>Some of Henry’s partizans in England now thought it
time for him to interfere, and despatched his uncle Reginald
earl of Cornwall to urge him to come over at once.<a id="Anchor_1151" href="#Footnote_1151" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1151.">[1151]</a> Soon
after Easter a meeting of the Norman barons—already summoned
by Henry in the previous autumn,<a id="Anchor_1152" href="#Footnote_1152" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1152.">[1152]</a> but delayed by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392">392</a></span>
the unexpected catastrophe of his father’s death—was held
at Lisieux to consider the matter.<a id="Anchor_1153" href="#Footnote_1153" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1153.">[1153]</a> But whatever the result
of their deliberations may have been, Henry found something
else to do before he could cross the sea. King Louis
<abbr title="7">VII.</abbr> had been meditating a divorce from his wife, the
Aquitanian duchess Eleanor, ever since their return from
the crusade. The great obstacle to his scheme was his
father’s and his own old friend and minister Suger, who saw
the grave political danger of such a measure and opposed it
with all the influence he possessed.<a id="Anchor_1154" href="#Footnote_1154" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1154.">[1154]</a> But Suger was dying;
and the king had made up his mind. He took the first
step at Christmas 1151 by going with Eleanor into Aquitaine
and withdrawing all his own garrisons from her
territories.<a id="Anchor_1155" href="#Footnote_1155" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1155.">[1155]</a> Suger’s death on January 13 recalled him to
Paris,<a id="Anchor_1156" href="#Footnote_1156" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1156.">[1156]</a> and at the same time set him free to accomplish his
desire unopposed. A Church council was held under the
presidency of Archbishop Hugh of Sens at Beaugency on
the Tuesday before Palm Sunday;<a id="Anchor_1157" href="#Footnote_1157" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1157.">[1157]</a> the king and queen
were made out to be akin, and their union was dissolved.<a id="Anchor_1158" href="#Footnote_1158" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1158.">[1158]</a>
Eleanor set out for her own dominions; she had however
some trouble in reaching them. She was young and
beautiful; her personal charms were more than equalled by
those of her two great duchies of Aquitaine and Gascony;
and more than one ambitious feudatary was eager to seize
the prize which his sovereign had thrown away. At her
first halting-place, Blois, the young count Theobald—son
and successor of Theobald the Great who had died two
months before<a id="Anchor_1159" href="#Footnote_1159" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1159.">[1159]</a>—sought to take her by force and make her
his wife. She fled by night to Tours, and there narrowly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393">393</a></span>
escaped being captured with the same intention by a still
more youthful admirer, Geoffrey of Anjou, Henry’s brother.
The audacious boy laid a plot to catch her at Port-de-Piles,
on the frontier of Touraine and Poitou; but she was warned
in time and made her escape by another road safe into her
own territory.<a id="Anchor_1160" href="#Footnote_1160" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1160.">[1160]</a> Thence she at once wrote to offer herself
and her lands to the husband of her own choice—Henry
duke of the Normans. He set out to join her immediately,
and at Whitsuntide they were married at Poitiers.<a id="Anchor_1161" href="#Footnote_1161" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1161.">[1161]</a></p>

proves that they
were married before May 27. Gervase’s story is the fullest; according to him,
they married for love, and Eleanor had herself procured the divorce for that
object—such, at least, was the story which she wrote to her young lover. As to
the question of consanguinity, that of Louis and Eleanor is not very clear; it was
at any rate more remote than that of Eleanor and Henry, who certainly were
within the forbidden degrees. One would like to know what <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard, who
had put a stop to a proposal of marriage between Henry and Eleanor’s daughter

thought of the matter; a
saint of the next generation, Hugh of Lincoln, thought and said plainly that it
was the fatal sin which was visited upon the children of the guilty couple in the
downfall of the Angevin empire.

In his eyes, however, the sin lay in the fact not of the kindred between
the parties, but of Eleanor’s divorce; and it is noteworthy that William of
Newburgh, who did not live to see the final catastrophe or to know the worst
crimes of Eleanor’s youngest son, took exactly the same view;

<p>Suger’s worst fears were now realized. Aquitaine was
lost to the king of France; it had gone to swell the forces
of the prince who was already the mightiest feudatary of the
realm, and who would probably be king of England ere
long; and as Louis and Eleanor had no son, there was very
little hope that even in the next generation it would revert
to the French Crown. In feudal law, an heiress had no right
to marry without the consent of her overlord. It seems that
Louis accordingly summoned Henry to appear before the
royal court and answer for his conduct in thus hastily
accepting Eleanor’s hand. But Henry Fitz-Empress, duke<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394">394</a></span>
of Normandy, count of Anjou, Touraine and Maine, and
duke of Aquitaine—for, rightly or wrongly, he was married,
and in full possession of his wife’s territories—master of
more than half Gaul, from the Flemish to the Spanish
March and from the Rhône to the ocean—could venture to
defy a mere king of the French. He therefore refused to
appear before the court or to acknowledge its jurisdiction in
any way.<a id="Anchor_1162" href="#Footnote_1162" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1162.">[1162]</a> Eustace seized the favourable moment to regain
the French alliance; he came over to visit King Louis; his

that Louis, Eustace, Robert of Dreux, Henry of Champagne,<a id="Anchor_1164" href="#Footnote_1164" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1164.">[1164]</a>

This is related
as a piece of shameful ingratitude for Louis’s supposed help towards the conquest
of Normandy. The story then proceeds to relate that Louis in wrath besieged
and took Vernon and Neufmarché, whereupon Henry humbly promised to be
more obedient for the future, and Louis, accepting his assurances, restored the
two castles. We are not told on what charge Henry had been cited to the court,
and no hint is given that the quarrel was in any way connected with his marriage,
which indeed is not mentioned till some time after. Yet I can find no indication
of any ground for such a citation, except the marriage; and that, indeed, would
be a most obvious pretext.

<p>Geoffrey by his father’s will had inherited Chinon,
Loudun and Mirebeau;<a id="Anchor_1166" href="#Footnote_1166" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1166.">[1166]</a> with this vantage-ground he began
operations against his brother’s authority in Anjou, while the
other four princes crossed the Norman border and laid siege
to Neufmarché. Henry set out from Barfleur on July 16
to relieve Neufmarché, but arrived too late to save it from
surrender;<a id="Anchor_1167" href="#Footnote_1167" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1167.">[1167]</a> Louis handed it over to Eustace,<a id="Anchor_1168" href="#Footnote_1168" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1168.">[1168]</a> and proceeded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_395">395</a></span>
to muster his forces near Chaumont in the French Vexin.
Henry did the like on the banks of the Andelle, and began
ravaging the country between that river and the Epte—the
old Norman Vexin, so lately ceded to Louis as the price of
his alliance. In August Louis brought his host across the
Seine at Meulan; Henry crossed lower down, by the bridge
of Vernon, and thinking that the king intended to attack
Verneuil, was hurrying to reach it before him when a
message from the lord of Pacy told him that this last place
was the one really threatened. He turned and proceeded
thither at such a pace that several of his horses fell dead on
the road; Louis, finding himself outwitted, gave up the
expedition and returned to Meulan. Henry next invaded
the county of Dreux, burned Brézolles and Marcouville,
took hostages from Richer de l’Aigle—Thomas Becket’s old
friend—whose fidelity was doubtful, and burned his castle of
Bonmoulins, which was said to be “a den of thieves”; he
then planted a line of garrisons all along the Norman
frontier, and at the end of August went down into Anjou.
There he blockaded the rebel leaders congregated in the
castle of Montsoreau on the Loire till most of them fell into
his hands, and his brother gave up the useless struggle.<a id="Anchor_1169" href="#Footnote_1169" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1169.">[1169]</a>
Louis meanwhile profited by his absence to burn part of
the town of Tillières and a village near Verneuil, and to
make an attempt upon Nonancourt, in which however he
failed.<a id="Anchor_1170" href="#Footnote_1170" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1170.">[1170]</a> Immediately afterwards he fell sick of a fever; his
army dissolved, and he was obliged to retire into his own
domains<a id="Anchor_1171" href="#Footnote_1171" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1171.">[1171]</a> and make proposals for a truce.<a id="Anchor_1172" href="#Footnote_1172" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1172.">[1172]</a> Henry was
ready enough to accept them; for he had just received
another urgent summons from England, and he felt that this
time it must be answered in person.</p>

<p>Since the Empress’s departure, Stephen had made but
little progress in reducing the castles of those barons who
still, either in her name or in their own, chose to defy his
authority. A revolt of Ralf of Chester and Gilbert of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_396">396</a></span>
Pembroke in 1149 and two unsuccessful attempts made by
the king to recover Worcester from Waleran of Meulan, to
whom he had himself intrusted it in the days when Waleran
was one of his best supporters,<a id="Anchor_1173" href="#Footnote_1173" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1173.">[1173]</a> make up almost the whole
military history of the last four years. Ralf of Chester’s
obstinate claim upon Lincoln was at last disposed of by
a compromise.<a id="Anchor_1174" href="#Footnote_1174" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1174.">[1174]</a> There was however one fortress which
throughout the whole course of the war had been, almost
more than any other, a special object of Stephen’s jealousy.
This was Wallingford, a castle of great strength seated on
the right bank of the Thames some twelve miles south of
Oxford, and held as a perpetual thorn in the king’s side by
a Breton adventurer, Brian Fitz-Count, one of the most
able and energetic as well as most faithful and persevering
members of the Angevin party in England. Hitherto all
Stephen’s attempts against Wallingford—even the erection
of a rival fortress, Crowmarsh, directly over against it—had
produced no effect at all. At last, in the winter of 1152,
he built a strong wooden tower at the foot of the bridge
over the Thames whereby alone the garrison of Wallingford
obtained their supplies. Brian and his men saw their
convoys hopelessly shut out; they knew that none of their
friends in England were strong enough to relieve them;
they therefore sent to their lord the young duke of the
Normans, and begged that he would either give them leave
to surrender with honour, or send help to deliver them out
of their strait.<a id="Anchor_1175" href="#Footnote_1175" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1175.">[1175]</a></p>

<p>Henry did not send; he came. Landing with a small
force on the morning of the Epiphany,<a id="Anchor_1176" href="#Footnote_1176" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1176.">[1176]</a> he entered a church
to honour the festival with such brief devotion as a soldier
could spare time for, and the first words that fell on his ear
sounded like an omen of success: <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397">397</a></span>“Behold, the Lord the
ruler cometh, and the kingdom is in his hand.”<a id="Anchor_1177" href="#Footnote_1177" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1177.">[1177]</a> Before the
week was out he had taken the town of Malmesbury and
the outworks of the castle, and was blockading Bishop
Roger’s impregnable keep. Stephen, warned by its commandant,
hastened to its relief. On a bitter January
morning king and duke, each at the head of his troops, met
for the first time face to face, divided only by the river
Avon—here at Malmesbury a mere streamlet in itself, but
so swollen by the winter’s rains that neither party dared
venture to cross it. A torrent of rain, sleet and hail was
pouring down, drifting before a violent west wind, striking
the Angevins in their backs, but beating hard in the faces
of the king and his host; drenched, blinded, scarce able to
hold their weapons, they stood shivering with cold and
terror, feeling as if Heaven itself had taken up arms against
them, till Stephen turned away in despair and led his
dispirited forces back to London. Malmesbury surrendered
as soon as he was gone.<a id="Anchor_1178" href="#Footnote_1178" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1178.">[1178]</a> The young duke marched straight
upon Wallingford, demolished Stephen’s wooden tower at
the first assault, and revictualled the castle. He then laid
siege to Crowmarsh. Stephen advanced to relieve it; again
the two armies fronted each other in battle array, but again
no battle took place. The barons, who were only anxious
to maintain both the rival sovereigns as a check upon each
other, and dreaded nothing so much as the complete triumph
of either, took advantage of a supposed bad omen which
befell the king<a id="Anchor_1179" href="#Footnote_1179" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1179.">[1179]</a> to insist upon a parley, and proposed that
Stephen and Henry in person should arrange terms with
each other, subject to ratification by their respective followers.<a id="Anchor_1180" href="#Footnote_1180" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1180.">[1180]</a>
Yielding to necessity, and both fully aware of their advisers’
disloyal motives, the two leaders held a colloquy across a
narrow reach of the Thames.<a id="Anchor_1181" href="#Footnote_1181" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1181.">[1181]</a> For the moment a truce<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398">398</a></span>
was arranged, on condition that Stephen should raze
Crowmarsh at the end of five days.<a id="Anchor_1182" href="#Footnote_1182" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1182.">[1182]</a> As the barons
doubtless expected, however, no solution was reached on
the main question at issue between the rivals, and with
mutual complaints of the treason of their followers they
separated once again.<a id="Anchor_1183" href="#Footnote_1183" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1183.">[1183]</a></p>

<p>But there were others who, in all sincerity, were labouring
hard for peace. Archbishop Theobald was in constant
communication with the king in person and with the duke
through trusty envoys, endeavouring to establish a basis for
negotiations between them. He found an ally in Henry of
Winchester, now eager to help in putting an end to troubles
which he at last perceived had been partly fostered by his
own errors.<a id="Anchor_1184" href="#Footnote_1184" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1184.">[1184]</a> The once rival prelates, thus united in their
best work, saw their chief obstacle in Eustace.<a id="Anchor_1185" href="#Footnote_1185" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1185.">[1185]</a> Not only
was it the hope of his son’s succession which made Stephen
cling so obstinately to every jot and tittle of his regal
claims; but Eustace’s character was such that the mere
possibility of his rule could not be contemplated without
dread; and to look for any self-renunciation on his part
was far more hopeless than to expect it from Stephen.
Eustace was in fact a most degenerate son, unworthy
not only of his high-souled mother but even of his weak,
amiable father. He had one merit—he was an excellent
soldier;<a id="Anchor_1186" href="#Footnote_1186" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1186.">[1186]</a> for the rest, his character was that of the house
of Blois in its most vicious phase, unredeemed by a spark
of the generous warmth and winning graciousness for
which so much had been forgiven to Stephen.<a id="Anchor_1187" href="#Footnote_1187" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1187.">[1187]</a> Even
with his own party and his own father he could not
keep at peace. The issue of the Crowmarsh expedition
threw him into a fury; after loading his father with
reproaches, he deserted him altogether and rode away to
Canterbury, vowing to ravage the whole country from end
to end, sparing neither the property of the churches nor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399">399</a></span>
the holy places themselves. He began with <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s
abbey. He was hospitably received there, but his demand
for money was refused, and he ordered the crops to be
destroyed. A century and a half before, the heathen
Danish conqueror Swein had in like manner insulted East
Anglia’s patron saint, and had been stricken down by a
sudden and mysterious death. So too it was with Eustace.
As he sat at table in the abbey, the first morsel of food
choked him, and in the convulsions of raging madness he
expired.<a id="Anchor_1188" href="#Footnote_1188" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1188.">[1188]</a></p>

<p>Eustace’s death was only one of a striking series. The
roll had opened with Geoffrey of Anjou in September 1151.
Suger and Theobald of Blois both died in January 1152.
Politically as well as personally, the death of the good and
wise brother who had stood by him so faithfully and so unselfishly
through all his difficulties in Normandy and at
Rome must have been a heavy blow to Stephen; but
heavier still was the blow that fell upon him three months
later, when on May 3 he lost the wisest, probably, of his
counsellors as well as the truest and bravest of all his
partizans in England—his queen, Matilda of Boulogne.<a id="Anchor_1189" href="#Footnote_1189" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1189.">[1189]</a>
She was followed in little more than a month by her cousin
Henry of Scotland.<a id="Anchor_1190" href="#Footnote_1190" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1190.">[1190]</a> Next year the list of remarkable
deaths was longer still. On this side of the sea it included,
besides Eustace, Ralf earl of Chester,<a id="Anchor_1191" href="#Footnote_1191" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1191.">[1191]</a> Walter Lespec,<a id="Anchor_1192" href="#Footnote_1192" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1192.">[1192]</a> and
David king of Scots.<a id="Anchor_1193" href="#Footnote_1193" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1193.">[1193]</a> Another person who had made some
figure in the history of northern England, William bishop of
Durham, had died in the previous November.<a id="Anchor_1194" href="#Footnote_1194" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1194.">[1194]</a> The appointment
of Hugh of Puiset to his vacant chair,<a id="Anchor_1195" href="#Footnote_1195" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1195.">[1195]</a> being strongly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400">400</a></span>
opposed by Archbishop Murdac, nearly caused another schism
in the province; the southern primate, however, doubtless
feeling that it was no time now for ecclesiastical squabbles,
took the case into his own hands and sent the elect of Durham
to be consecrated at Rome by the Pope.<a id="Anchor_1196" href="#Footnote_1196" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1196.">[1196]</a> But the Pope
was no longer Eugene <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> Rome lost her Cistercian bishop
on July 9, 1153. Six weeks later Clairvaux itself became
a valley of the shadow of death, as its light passed away
with <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard;<a id="Anchor_1197" href="#Footnote_1197" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1197.">[1197]</a> and two months later still the metropolitan
chair of York was again vacated, and the three great
Cistercian fellow-workers were reunited in their rest, by the
death of Henry Murdac.<a id="Anchor_1198" href="#Footnote_1198" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1198.">[1198]</a> The generation which had been
young with Stephen seemed to be rapidly passing away;
the primate, the bishop of Winchester and the king himself
were left almost alone, like survivors of a past age, in
presence of the younger race represented by Henry of
Anjou.</p>

<p>With the life of Eustace ended the resistance of Stephen.
He had other sons, but they were mere boys; it was hopeless
to think of setting up even the eldest of them as a rival
to Henry. The young duke was carrying all before him;
Stamford, Nottingham,<a id="Anchor_1199" href="#Footnote_1199" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1199.">[1199]</a> Reading, Barkwell, had yielded to
him already, when Countess Gundrada of Warwick surrendered
Warwick castle,<a id="Anchor_1200" href="#Footnote_1200" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1200.">[1200]</a> and the adhesion of Earl Robert
of Leicester placed more than thirty fortresses all at once at
the young conqueror’s disposal.<a id="Anchor_1201" href="#Footnote_1201" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1201.">[1201]</a> Henry was, however, fully
alive to the wisdom of securing his kingdom by a legal
settlement rather than by the mere power of the sword.
At last a treaty was made, on November 6, in the place
where it had been first projected—Wallingford.<a id="Anchor_1202" href="#Footnote_1202" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1202.">[1202]</a> It was
agreed that Stephen and Henry should adopt each other as
father and son; that Stephen should keep his regal dignity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401">401</a></span>
for the rest of his life, Henry acting as justiciar and practical
ruler of the kingdom under him; and that after his death
Henry should be king.<a id="Anchor_1203" href="#Footnote_1203" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1203.">[1203]</a> The details of the settlement have
come down to us only in a poetical shape which expresses
not so much what the contracting parties actually undertook
to do as what needed to be done—what was the ideal
at which the peace-makers aimed, and how far removed
from it was the actual condition of the country. The rights
of the Crown, which the nobles had everywhere usurped,
were to be resumed; the “adulterine castles”—castles built
during the anarchy and without the king’s leave, to the
number of eleven hundred and fifteen—were to be destroyed;
all property was to be restored to the lawful
owners who had held it in King Henry’s time. The farms
were again to be supplied with husbandmen; the houses
which had been burnt down were to be rebuilt and filled
with inhabitants; the woods were to be provided with
foresters, the coverts replenished with game, the hill-sides
covered with flocks of sheep and the meadows with herds
of cattle. The clergy were to enjoy tranquillity and peace,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402">402</a></span>
and to be relieved from all extraordinary and exorbitant
demands. The sheriffs were to be regularly appointed in
accustomed places, and held strictly to their duties; they
were not to indulge their greed, nor to prosecute any one
out of malice, nor shew undue favour to their own friends,
nor condone crimes, but to render to every man his due;
some they were to influence by the threat of punishment,
others by the promise of reward. Thieves and robbers were
to be punished with death. Soldiers were to beat their
swords into ploughshares and their spears into pruning-hooks;
the Flemings were to quit the camp for the farm, the tent
for the workshop, and render to their own masters the
service which they had so long forced upon the English
people; the country-folk were to dwell in undisturbed
security, the merchants to grow rich through the revival of
trade. Finally, one standard of money was to be current
throughout the realm.<a id="Anchor_1204" href="#Footnote_1204" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1204.">[1204]</a></p>

in
    <cite>Rymer’s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fœdera</i>, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 18</cite>.
Its date is Westminster, 1153, and it is in form
of a writ addressed to the archbishops, bishops, barons, and all faithful subjects,
proclaiming and notifying to them the treaty just made. The primary article,
concerning the adoption of Henry as heir, is stated exactly as by the chroniclers.
The remainder of the document relates entirely to details of homage done by
prelates and barons to Henry, stipulations in behalf of Stephen’s son William,
and arrangements for surrender of royal castles to Henry on Stephen’s death.
Finally: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">In negotiis autem regni ego consilio ducis operabor. Ego vero in toto
regno Angliæ, tam in parte ducis quam in meâ, regalem justiciam exercebo.</span>”
By “the duke’s part” and “my part” Stephen probably meant simply the parts
which each held at the moment; the whole clause seems to mean that the regal
justice was to be exercised in his name and for his profit, but by Henry’s wisdom—which
agrees very well with <abbr title="Roger of">Rog.</abbr> Howden’s statement.

<p>The treaty was ratified in an assembly of bishops, earls
and barons, held at Winchester at the end of the month.<a id="Anchor_1205" href="#Footnote_1205" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1205.">[1205]</a>
Stephen afterwards accompanied his adoptive son to London,
where he was joyfully welcomed by the citizens.<a id="Anchor_1206" href="#Footnote_1206" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1206.">[1206]</a> King and
duke seem to have kept Christmas apart; Henry indeed set
himself to his task of reform in such earnest that he could
have little time to spare for mere festivities. On the octave
of Epiphany another assembly was held at Oxford, where
the nobles of England swore homage and fealty to the duke
as to their lord, reserving only the faith due to Stephen as
long as he lived. The next meeting, at Dunstable, was not
quite so satisfactory. Henry, doing his share of the public
work with true Angevin thoroughness, was irritated at finding
that some of the builders of unlicensed castles had
gained the king’s ear and persuaded him to exempt their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_403">403</a></span>
fortresses from the sentence of universal destruction.
Against this breach of faith the duke earnestly remonstrated;
but he found it impossible to enforce his wishes
without a quarrel which he was too prudent to risk.<a id="Anchor_1207" href="#Footnote_1207" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1207.">[1207]</a> He
therefore let the matter rest, and in Lent he accompanied
Stephen to Canterbury and thence to a meeting with the
count and countess of Flanders at Dover.<a id="Anchor_1208" href="#Footnote_1208" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1208.">[1208]</a> There it was
discovered that some of the Flemish mercenaries, to whom
Henry and his good peace were equally hateful,<a id="Anchor_1209" href="#Footnote_1209" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1209.">[1209]</a> were conspiring
to kill him on his return to Canterbury. The shock
of this discovery, added to that of an accident which befell
Stephen’s eldest surviving son William, who is said to have
been aware of the plot,<a id="Anchor_1210" href="#Footnote_1210" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1210.">[1210]</a> was too much for the king’s overwrought
nerves, and with a last benediction he hurried his
adoptive son out of the country at once.<a id="Anchor_1211" href="#Footnote_1211" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1211.">[1211]</a> Henry passed
through Canterbury before the conspirators were ready for
him, made his way to Rochester and London, and thence
safe over sea to Normandy,<a id="Anchor_1212" href="#Footnote_1212" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1212.">[1212]</a> where he landed soon after
Easter.<a id="Anchor_1213" href="#Footnote_1213" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1213.">[1213]</a></p>

<p>Only fifteen months had passed since his arrival in
England; only five had passed since the treaty of Wallingford;
yet in that short time Henry had made, as the contemporary
English chronicler says, “such good peace as
never was here”<a id="Anchor_1214" href="#Footnote_1214" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1214.">[1214]</a>—never, that is, since peace and order
were buried with his grandfather, eighteen years before. So
well was the work begun that even when he was thus
obliged to leave it for a while in the weak hands of Stephen,
it did not fall to pieces again. Stephen indeed, as was remarked
by the writers of the day, seemed now at length for
the first time to be really king.<a id="Anchor_1215" href="#Footnote_1215" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1215.">[1215]</a> For eighteen years he had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404">404</a></span>
been king only in name; his regal dignity had never been
truly respected, his regal authority had never been fully
obeyed, till the last twelve months of his life, when he was
avowedly only holding them in trust for the future sovereign
whom “all folk loved,” because he did what Stephen had
failed to do—“he did good justice and made peace.”<a id="Anchor_1216" href="#Footnote_1216" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1216.">[1216]</a> After
Henry was gone Stephen gathered up his failing strength for a
campaign against some of the rebellious castles in the north.
Sick and weary as he was, his youthful valour and prowess
were even yet not altogether departed; castle after castle fell
into his hands, the last and most important being that of
Drax in Yorkshire.<a id="Anchor_1217" href="#Footnote_1217" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1217.">[1217]</a> He then went southward again to
hold another meeting with the count of Flanders at Dover.<a id="Anchor_1218" href="#Footnote_1218" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1218.">[1218]</a>
There his health finally gave way; and eight days before
the feast of All Saints his nineteen years’ reign, with all its
troubles and disappointments, its blunders and failures, its
useless labours and hopeless cares, was ended by a quiet
death.<a id="Anchor_1219" href="#Footnote_1219" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1219.">[1219]</a></p>

<p>The primate and the nobles, while they laid him in
Feversham abbey beside his wife and son,<a id="Anchor_1220" href="#Footnote_1220" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1220.">[1220]</a> sent the news to
the king-elect, begging him to come and take his crown
without delay.<a id="Anchor_1221" href="#Footnote_1221" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1221.">[1221]</a> The message reached Henry just as he was
completing the suppression of a disturbance in Normandy.
A series of desultory attacks made by the French king upon
the duchy during Henry’s absence in 1153 had led to no
direct result, but they probably helped to foster the turbulence
of the Norman barons, who were fast getting into
their old condition of lawless independence when at Easter
1154 the duke re-appeared in their midst. He began to
assert his authority by resuming—not all at once, but gradually
and cautiously—the demesne lands of the duchy,
which his father had been compelled to alienate for a time<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_405">405</a></span>
in order to purchase the support of the nobles. A hurried
visit to Aquitaine was followed in August by peace with
the king of France; for Louis had at last come to see that
his opposition was as vain as Stephen’s. Immediately afterwards
the young duke was struck down by a severe illness.
In October he was sufficiently recovered to join Louis in a
campaign for the settlement of some disturbances in the
Vexin; thence he went once more to besiege his rebellious
cousin and vassal Richard Fitz-Count at Torigni. The
place had apparently just surrendered when the tidings of
Stephen’s death arrived. Henry took counsel first of all
with his mother; then he summoned his brothers and the
barons of Normandy to meet him at Barfleur; but when he
arrived there with Eleanor the wind was so unfavourable
that a whole month elapsed before they could venture to
cross.<a id="Anchor_1222" href="#Footnote_1222" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1222.">[1222]</a> Henry, however, could afford to wait; and England
could wait for him. Three weeks without a king had been
enough to throw the whole country into disorder when
Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> had died leaving only a woman and an infant as
his heirs; six weeks passed away without any disturbance
now while Archbishop Theobald was guarding the rights of
the Crown<a id="Anchor_1223" href="#Footnote_1223" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1223.">[1223]</a> for one who had already proved himself King
Henry’s worthy grandson. “No man durst do other than
good, for the mickle awe of him.”<a id="Anchor_1224" href="#Footnote_1224" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1224.">[1224]</a> At last, on December
8,<a id="Anchor_1225" href="#Footnote_1225" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1225.">[1225]</a> he landed in Hampshire;<a id="Anchor_1226" href="#Footnote_1226" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1226.">[1226]</a> first at Winchester, then in
London, he received a rapturous welcome;<a id="Anchor_1227" href="#Footnote_1227" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1227.">[1227]</a> and on the
Sunday before Christmas Henry Fitz-Empress, duke of the

<span class="ch1">CHAPTER <abbr title="9">IX.</abbr></span><br />

<span class="ch2">HENRY AND ENGLAND.</span><br />

<span class="ch3">1154–1157.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">The</span> Christmas-tide of the year 1154 was an epoch in
English history almost as marked as that of 1066. The
crowning of Henry Fitz-Empress was, scarcely less than that
of William the Conqueror, the beginning of a new era; and—unlike
many historical events whose importance is only
realized long after they are past—it was distinctly recognized
as such by the men of the period. For the first time
since the Norman conquest, the new king succeeded to his
throne without a competitor, and with the unanimous goodwill
of all ranks and all races throughout his kingdom.
Normans and English, high and low, cleric and lay, welcomed
the young Angevin king as the herald of a bright
new day which was to dispel the darkness that had settled
down upon the land during the nineteen winters of anarchy,
and to bring back all, or more than all, the peace and prosperity
of England’s happiest ages. But if Henry’s subjects
looked forward to the year which was just beginning with a
hope such as no new year had brought them since his
grandfather’s death, Henry himself may well have contemplated
with an anxiety little short of despair the task which
lay before him. It was nothing less than the resuscitation
of the body politic from a state of utter decay. The
legal, constitutional and administrative machinery of the
state was at a deadlock; the national resources, material
and moral, were exhausted. To bring under subjection,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408">408</a></span>
once for all, the remnant of the disturbing forces which
had caused the catastrophe, and render them powerless
for future harm<span class="nobreak">:—</span>to disinter from the mass of ruin the
fragments of the old foundations of social and political
organization, and build up on them a secure and lasting
fabric of administration and law;—to bring order out of
chaos, life out of decay<span class="nobreak">:—</span>this was the work which a youth
who had not yet completed his twenty-second year now
found himself called to undertake, and to undertake almost
single-handed.</p>

<p>The call did not indeed take him by surprise. The last
year which he had spent in England must have given him
some knowledge of the state of things with which as
king he would have to deal; and the prospect of having
so to deal with it sooner or later had been constantly
before his eyes from his very infancy. His qualifications
for the work must however have been chiefly innate.
The first nine years of his life spent under the care
of mother and father alternately in Anjou; the next four,
under his uncle Earl Robert at Bristol; then two years
in Anjou again, followed by a year with King David
of Scotland, three more spent in securing his continental
heritage and that of his bride, a year occupied in
securing England, and another busied with self-defence in
Normandy<span class="nobreak">:—</span>such a training was too desultory to have
furnished Henry with the knowledge or the experience
necessary for the formation of anything like a matured
theory of government; and he could have had no time to
think out one for himself in a life so busy and so short. Yet
in his very youth and inexperience there was an element of
strength. He came trammelled by no preconceived political
theories, no party-pledges, no local and personal ties; he
came simply with his own young intellect unwarped by
prejudice, unruffled by passion, unclouded by care; fresh
with the untried vigour and elasticity of youth, and ready,
whatever his hand should find to do, fearlessly to do it with
his might.</p>

<p>Thus much, at least, those who crowded to welcome the
new sovereign might read in his very face and figure.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409">409</a></span>
Henry of Anjou had no claim to the personal epithet
universally bestowed upon his father; and yet, as one of
his courtiers expressively said, his was a form which a
soldier, having once seen, would hasten to look upon again.<a id="Anchor_1229" href="#Footnote_1229" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1229.">[1229]</a>
He was of moderate height,<a id="Anchor_1230" href="#Footnote_1230" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1230.">[1230]</a> appearing neither gigantic
among small men nor insignificant among tall ones;<a id="Anchor_1231" href="#Footnote_1231" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1231.">[1231]</a> in
later days it was remarked that he had hit the golden
mean of stature which his sons had all either overshot
or failed to attain.<a id="Anchor_1232" href="#Footnote_1232" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1232.">[1232]</a> His frame was made for strength,
endurance and activity;<a id="Anchor_1233" href="#Footnote_1233" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1233.">[1233]</a> thick-set, square-shouldered, broad-chested<span class="nobreak">:—</span>with
arms muscular as those of a gladiator;<a id="Anchor_1234" href="#Footnote_1234" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1234.">[1234]</a>
highly-arched feet which looked made for the stirrup;<a id="Anchor_1235" href="#Footnote_1235" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1235.">[1235]</a>—a
large, but not disproportionate head, round and
well-shaped, and covered with close-cropped hair of the
tawny hue which Fulk the Red seems to have transmitted
to so many of his descendants:<a id="Anchor_1236" href="#Footnote_1236" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1236.">[1236]</a> a face which
one of his courtiers describes as “lion-like”<a id="Anchor_1237" href="#Footnote_1237" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1237.">[1237]</a> and another
as “a countenance of fire”<a id="Anchor_1238" href="#Footnote_1238" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1238.">[1238]</a>—a face, as we can see
even in its sculptured effigy on his tomb, full of animation,
energy and vigour;—a freckled skin;<a id="Anchor_1239" href="#Footnote_1239" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1239.">[1239]</a> somewhat prominent
grey eyes, clear and soft when he was in a peaceable
mood, but bloodshot and flashing like balls of fire when
the demon-spirit of his race was aroused within him<span class="nobreak">:—</span><a id="Anchor_1240" href="#Footnote_1240" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1240.">[1240]</a> Henry,
his people might guess almost at a glance, was
no mirror of courtly chivalry and elegance, but a man of
practical, vigorous and rapid action. He inherited as little
of Geoffrey’s personal refinement as of his physical grace.
When the young duke of the Normans had first appeared in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410">410</a></span>
England, his shoulders covered with a little short cape such
as was then usually worn in Anjou, the English knights,
who since his grandfather’s time had been accustomed to
wear long cloaks hanging down to the ground, were struck
by the novelty of his attire and nicknamed him “Henry
Curtmantel.”<a id="Anchor_1241" href="#Footnote_1241" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1241.">[1241]</a> When once the Angevin fashion was transferred
to the English court, however, there was nothing in
Henry’s dress to distinguish him from his servants, unless it
were its very lack of display and elegance; his clothing and
headgear were of the plainest kind; and how little care he
took of his person was shewn by his rough coarse hands,
never gloved except when he went hawking.<a id="Anchor_1242" href="#Footnote_1242" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1242.">[1242]</a> In his later
years he was accused of extreme parsimony;<a id="Anchor_1243" href="#Footnote_1243" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1243.">[1243]</a> even as a
young man, he clearly had no pleasure in pomp or luxury
of any kind. He was very temperate in meat and drink;<a id="Anchor_1244" href="#Footnote_1244" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1244.">[1244]</a>
over-indulgence in that respect seems indeed never to have
been one of the habitual sins of the house of Anjou; and
whatever complex elements may have had a part in his
innermost moral constitution, in temper and tastes Henry
was an Angevin of the Angevins. His restlessness seems
to have outdone that of Fulk Nerra himself. He was
always up and doing; if a dream of ease crossed him even
in sleep, he spurned it angrily from him;<a id="Anchor_1245" href="#Footnote_1245" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1245.">[1245]</a> he gave himself
no peace, and as a natural consequence, he gave none to
those around him. When not at war, he was constantly
practising its mimicry with hawk and hound; his passion
for the chase—a double inheritance, from his father and
from his mother’s Norman ancestors—was so great as to be
an acknowledged scandal in all eyes.<a id="Anchor_1246" href="#Footnote_1246" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1246.">[1246]</a> He would mount
his horse at the first streak of dawn, come back in the evening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411">411</a></span>
after a day’s hard riding across hill, moor and forest, and
then tire out his companions by keeping them on their feet
until nightfall.<a id="Anchor_1247" href="#Footnote_1247" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1247.">[1247]</a> His own feet were always swollen and
bruised from his violent riding; yet except at meals and
on horseback, he was never known to be seated.<a id="Anchor_1248" href="#Footnote_1248" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1248.">[1248]</a> In public
or in private, in council or in church, he stood or walked
from morning till night.<a id="Anchor_1249" href="#Footnote_1249" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1249.">[1249]</a> At church, indeed, he was
especially restless; unmindful of the sacred unction which
had made him king, he evidently grudged the time taken
from secular occupations for attendance upon religious
duties, and would either discuss affairs of state in a whisper<a id="Anchor_1250" href="#Footnote_1250" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1250.">[1250]</a>
or relieve his impatience by drawing little pictures all
through the most solemn of holy rites.<a id="Anchor_1251" href="#Footnote_1251" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1251.">[1251]</a> His English or
Norman courtiers, unaccustomed to deal with the demon-blood
of Anjou, vainly endeavoured to account for an
activity which remained undiminished when they were
all half dead with exhaustion, and attributed it to his
dread of becoming disabled by corpulence, to which he
had a strong natural tendency.<a id="Anchor_1252" href="#Footnote_1252" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1252.">[1252]</a> A good deal of it, however,
was probably due to sheer physical restlessness and
superabundant physical energy; and a good deal more to
the irrepressible outward working of an extraordinarily
active mind.</p>

<p>It was no light matter to be in attendance upon such a
king. His clerks, some playfully, some in all seriousness,
compared his court to the infernal regions.<a id="Anchor_1253" href="#Footnote_1253" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1253.">[1253]</a> His habit of
constantly moving about from one place to another—a habit
which he retained to the very end of his life—was in itself
sufficiently trying to those who had to transact business with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412">412</a></span>
him, and was made positively exasperating by his frequent
and sudden changes of plan. “He shunned regular hours
like poison.”<a id="Anchor_1254" href="#Footnote_1254" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1254.">[1254]</a> “Solomon saith,” wrote his secretary Peter
of Blois to him once, after vainly striving to track him across
land and sea, “Solomon saith there be three things difficult
to be found out, and a fourth which may hardly be discovered:
the way of an eagle in the air; the way of a ship
in the sea; the way of a serpent on the ground; and the
way of a man in his youth. I can add a fifth: the way of
a king in England.”<a id="Anchor_1255" href="#Footnote_1255" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1255.">[1255]</a> In a letter to his old comrades of
the court Peter gives a detailed account of the discomforts
brought upon them by Henry’s erratic movements. <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413">413</a></span>“If the
king has promised to spend the day in a place—more
especially, if his intention so to do has been publicly proclaimed
by a herald—you may be quite sure he will upset
everybody’s arrangements by starting off early in the morning.
Then you may see men rushing about as if they were
mad, beating their packhorses, driving their chariots one
into another—in short, such a turmoil as to present you
with a lively image of the infernal regions. If, on the other
hand, the king announces that he will set out early in the
morning for a certain place, he is sure to change his mind;
you may take it for granted that he will sleep till noon.
Then you shall see the packhorses waiting with their burthens,
the chariots standing ready, the couriers dozing, the
purveyors worrying, and all grumbling one at another. Folk
run to the women and the tent-keepers to inquire of them
whither the king is really going; for this sort of courtiers
often know the secrets of the palace. Many a time when
the king was asleep and all was silent around, there has
come a message from his lodging, not authoritative, but
rousing us all up, and naming the city or town whither he
was about to proceed. After waiting so long in dreary uncertainty,
we were comforted by a prospect of being quartered
in a place where there was a fair chance of accommodation.
Thereupon arose such a clatter of horse and
foot that hell seemed to have broken loose. But when our
couriers had gone the whole day’s ride, or nearly so, the
king would turn aside to some other place where he had
perhaps one single house, and just enough provision for himself
and none else. I hardly dare say it,” adds the sorely-tried
secretary, “but I verily believe he took a delight in seeing
the straits to which he put us! After wandering a distance
of three or four miles in an unknown wood, and often in the
dark, we thought ourselves lucky if we stumbled upon some
dirty little hovel; there was often grievous and bitter strife
about a mere hut; and swords were drawn for the possession
of a lodging which pigs would not have deemed
worth fighting for. I used to get separated from my people,
and could hardly collect them again in three days. O Lord
God Almighty! wilt Thou not turn the heart of this king, that
he may know himself to be but man, and may learn to shew
some grace of regal consideration, some human fellow-feeling,
for those whom not ambition, but necessity, compels to
run after him thus?”<a id="Anchor_1256" href="#Footnote_1256" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1256.">[1256]</a></p>

<p>This bustling, scrambling, roving Pandemonium was
very unlike the orderly, well-disciplined court of the first
King Henry, where everything was done according to rule;—where
the royal itinerary was planned out every month, and
its stages duly announced and strictly adhered to, so that
every man knew exactly when and where to find his
sovereign, and his coming brought people together as to a
fair<span class="nobreak">:—</span>where all the earls and barons of the realm were set
down in a written list, according to which every one on his
arrival at court was furnished with a certain allowance of
bread, wine and candles for the term of his sojourn;<a id="Anchor_1257" href="#Footnote_1257" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1257.">[1257]</a>—where
the king’s own daily life was passed in a steady
routine, holding council with his wise men and giving
audiences until dinner-time, devoting the rest of the day
to the society of the young gallants whom he drew from
every country on this side of the Alps to increase the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414">414</a></span>
splendour of his household<span class="nobreak">:—</span>a court which was “a school
of virtue and wisdom all the morning, of courtesy and
decorous mirth all the afternoon.”<a id="Anchor_1258" href="#Footnote_1258" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1258.">[1258]</a> Yet this hasty, impetuous
young sovereign, in whose rough aspect and reckless
ways one can at first glance discern so little either of regal
dignity or of steady application to regal duty, was in truth,
no less than his grandfather, an indefatigable worker and a
born ruler of men. His way of doing business, apparently
by fits and starts, bewildered men of less versatile intellect
and less rapid decision; but they saw that the business was
done, and done thoroughly, though they hardly understood
when or how. They resigned themselves to be swept along
in the whirl of Henry’s unaccountable movements, for they
learned to perceive that those movements did not spring
from mere caprice and perversity, but had always a motive
and an object, inscrutable perhaps to all eyes save his own,
but none the less definite and practical. When he dragged
them in one day over a distance which should have occupied
four or five, they knew that it was to forestall the machinations
of some threatening foe. When he ran over the
country from end to end without a word of notice, it was to
overtake his officials at unawares and ascertain for himself
how they were or were not attending to their duty.<a id="Anchor_1259" href="#Footnote_1259" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1259.">[1259]</a> If he
was never still, he was also never idle. He seemed to be
specially haunted by that dread of the mischief attendant
upon idle hands which an Angevin writer quaintly puts
forth as an apology for the ceaseless warfare in which his
race passed their lives.<a id="Anchor_1260" href="#Footnote_1260" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1260.">[1260]</a> Henry’s hands were never idle; in
the intervals of state business, when not laden with bow and
arrows, they almost invariably held a book; for Henry was,
to the very close of his life, the most learned crowned head
in Christendom.<a id="Anchor_1261" href="#Footnote_1261" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1261.">[1261]</a> He was a match for the best among his
subjects in all knightly exercises and accomplishments; he
was no less a match for the best, among laymen at least, in
scholarship and mental culture. If we may believe one of
his chaplains, Walter Map, he knew something of every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415">415</a></span>
language “from the bay of Biscay to the Jordan,” though he
only spoke two, Latin and his native French;<a id="Anchor_1262" href="#Footnote_1262" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1262.">[1262]</a> he evidently
never learned to speak, and it is doubtful how far he understood,
the natural tongue of the people of his island realm. He loved
reading; he enjoyed the society of learned men; his delight
was to stand amid a little group of clerks, arguing out some
knotty point with them; not a day passed in his court without
some interesting literary discussion.<a id="Anchor_1263" href="#Footnote_1263" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1263.">[1263]</a> His habit of shutting
himself up in his own apartments with a few chosen
companions was a grievance to those who remembered his
grandfather’s practice of coming forth in public at stated
hours every day;<a id="Anchor_1264" href="#Footnote_1264" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1264.">[1264]</a> yet Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> was never difficult of
access; once, when the prior of Witham made a witty
retort to the marshals who refused him admittance to the
royal chamber, the king himself, overhearing the jest, opened
the door with a peal of laughter;<a id="Anchor_1265" href="#Footnote_1265" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1265.">[1265]</a> and a courier charged
with important news from the north made his way to the

<p>His worst private vices only reached their full developement
in later years; it is plain, however, that he was much
less careful than his grandfather had been of the outward
decorum of his household; and unluckily his consort was
not a woman to control it by her influence or improve it by
her example like the “good Queen Maude.” His wrath
was even more terrific than the wrath of kings is proverbially
wont to be.<a id="Anchor_1272" href="#Footnote_1272" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1272.">[1272]</a> His passions were strong, and they were lasting;
when once he had taken a dislike to a man, he could
rarely be induced to grant him his favour; on the other
hand, when his friendship and confidence were once given,
he withdrew them with the utmost difficulty and reluctance;<a id="Anchor_1273" href="#Footnote_1273" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1273.">[1273]</a>
and he had the gift of inspiring in all who came in contact
with him a love or a hatred as intense and abiding as his
own. His temper was a mystery to those who had not the
key to it; it was the temper of Fulk Nerra. He had the
Black Count’s strange power of fascination, his unaccountable
variations of mood, and his cool, clear head. Like
Fulk, he was at one moment mocking and blaspheming all
that is holiest in earth and heaven, and at another grovelling
in an agony of remorse as wild as the blasphemy itself.
Like Fulk, he was an indefatigable builder, constantly superintending
the erection of a wall, the fortification of a castle,
the making of a dyke, the enclosing of a deer-park or a
fish-pond, or the planning of a palace;<a id="Anchor_1274" href="#Footnote_1274" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1274.">[1274]</a> and all the while
his material buildings were but types of a great edifice of
statecraft which, all unseen, was rising day by day beneath
the hands of the royal architect;—his ever-varying pursuits,
each of which seemed to absorb him for the moment, were
but parts of an all-absorbing whole;—and his seeming self-contradictions
were unaccountable only because the most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417">417</a></span>
useful of all his Angevin characteristics, his capacity for
instinctively and unerringly adapting means to ends, enabled
him to detect opportunities and recognize combinations
invisible to less penetrating eyes. This was the moral constitution
which in Fulk <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> and Fulk <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr> had made the
greatness of the house of Anjou; its workings were now to
be displayed on a grander scale and in a more important
sphere.</p>

<p>The young king saw at once that for his work of reconstruction
and reform in England the counsellors who surrounded
him in Normandy were of no avail; that he must
trust solely to English help, and select his chief ministers
partly from among those who had been in office under his
predecessor, partly from such of his own English partizans
as were best fitted for the task. First among the former
class stood Richard de Lucy, who held the post of justiciar
at the close of Stephen’s reign,<a id="Anchor_1275" href="#Footnote_1275" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1275.">[1275]</a> who retained it under Henry
for five-and-twenty years, and whose character is summed
up in the epithet said to have been bestowed on him by his
grateful sovereign—“Richard de Lucy the Loyal.”<a id="Anchor_1276" href="#Footnote_1276" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1276.">[1276]</a> For
thirteen years he shared the dignity and the duties of chief
justiciar with Earl Robert of Leicester,<a id="Anchor_1277" href="#Footnote_1277" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1277.">[1277]</a> who, after having
been a faithful supporter of Stephen in his earlier and better
days, had transferred his allegiance to Henry, and continued
through life one of his most trusty servants and friends.
The weight of Robert’s character was increased by that of
his rank and descent; as head
of the great house of Leicester, he was the most
influential baron of the midland shires; while as son of
Count Robert of Meulan, the friend of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, he was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418">418</a></span>
living link with that hallowed past which Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> was
expected to restore, and a natural representative of its traditions
of honour and of peace. Of the great ministers who
had actually served under the first King Henry only one
survived: the old treasurer, Nigel, bishop of Ely. We
know not who took his place on his fall in 1139; but the
treasurer in Stephen’s latter years can have had little more
than an empty title; and when Nigel reappears in office,
immediately after Henry’s accession, it is not as treasurer,
but as chancellor.<a id="Anchor_1278" href="#Footnote_1278" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1278.">[1278]</a> This, however, was a merely provisional
arrangement; in a few weeks the bishop of Ely was reinstated
in his most appropriate place, on the right side of the
chequered table, gathering up the broken threads of the
financial system which he had learned under his uncle of
Salisbury;<a id="Anchor_1279" href="#Footnote_1279" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1279.">[1279]</a> while the more miscellaneous work of the chancellor
was undertaken by younger hands.</p>

<p>Under the old English constitutional system, alike in
its native purity and in the modified form which it assumed
under the Conqueror and his sons, the archbishop of Canterbury
was the official keeper of the royal conscience and
the first adviser of the sovereign. Theobald had contributed
more than any other one man to secure Henry’s
succession; he saw in it the crowning of his own life’s work
for England; while Henry saw in Theobald his most weighty
and valuable supporter. It was therefore a matter of course
that the primate should resume the constitutional position
which he had inherited from Anselm and Lanfranc and their
old-English predecessors. Theobald, however, was now in
advanced age and feeble health; and when he fully perceived
what manner of man it was to whom he was bound
to act as spiritual father and political guide, he felt that to
regulate these strong passions, to direct these youthful impulses,
to follow these restless movements, was a task too
hard for his failing strength. He feared the evil influences
of the courtiers upon the young king, who seemed so willing
to be led aright, and might for that very reason be so easily<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419">419</a></span>
led astray;<a id="Anchor_1280" href="#Footnote_1280" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1280.">[1280]</a> he feared for the English Church, through
which there was already running a whisper of ill-omen concerning
the Angevins’ known hostility to the rights of
religion;<a id="Anchor_1281" href="#Footnote_1281" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1281.">[1281]</a> he feared for his own soul, lest Henry should
wander out of the right path for lack of guidance, and the
sin should lie at the door of the incompetent guide.<a id="Anchor_1282" href="#Footnote_1282" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1282.">[1282]</a> There
was one man who, if he could but be placed at the young
king’s side, might be trusted to manage the arduous and
delicate task. So to place him could be no very difficult
matter; for his own past services to Henry’s cause were
far too great to be left unrewarded. Neither the recommendations
of the bishops of Winchester,<a id="Anchor_1283" href="#Footnote_1283" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1283.">[1283]</a> Bayeux
and Lisieux,<a id="Anchor_1284" href="#Footnote_1284" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1284.">[1284]</a> nor even those of the primate, could have as
much weight as the known qualifications of the candidate
himself in obtaining the office of chancellor for Thomas
Becket.<a id="Anchor_1285" href="#Footnote_1285" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1285.">[1285]</a></p>

<p>The chancellor’s duties were still much the same as they
had been when first organized by Roger of Salisbury. He
was charged with the keeping of the royal seal, the drawing-up
of royal writs and charters, the conduct of the royal correspondence,
the preservation of legal records, the custody of
vacant fiefs and benefices, and the superintendence of the
king’s chaplains and clerks;<a id="Anchor_1286" href="#Footnote_1286" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1286.">[1286]</a>—in a word, the management
of the whole clerical and secretarial work of the royal household
and of the government. Officially, he seems to have
been ranked below the chief ministers of state—the justiciar,
or even the treasurer;<a id="Anchor_1287" href="#Footnote_1287" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1287.">[1287]</a> personally, however, he was brought<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420">420</a></span>
more than either of them into close and constant relations
with his sovereign. The actual importance and dignity of
the chancellorship depended in fact upon the capacity of
individual chancellors for magnifying their office. Thomas
magnified it as no man ever did before or since. In a very
few months he became what the justiciar had formerly been,
the second man in the kingdom;<a id="Anchor_1288" href="#Footnote_1288" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1288.">[1288]</a> and not in the kingdom
alone, but in all the lands, on both sides of the sea, which
owned Henry Fitz-Empress for their sovereign.<a id="Anchor_1289" href="#Footnote_1289" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1289.">[1289]</a> Theobald’s
scheme far more than succeeded; his favourite became not
so much the king’s chief minister as his friend, his director,
his master.<a id="Anchor_1290" href="#Footnote_1290" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1290.">[1290]</a> The two young men, drawn together by a
strong personal attraction, seemed to have but one heart and
one soul.<a id="Anchor_1291" href="#Footnote_1291" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1291.">[1291]</a> Thomas was the elder by fifteen years; but the
disparity of age was lost in the perfect community of their
feelings, interests and pursuits. Thomas was now in
deacon’s orders, having been ordained by Archbishop
Theobald at the close of the previous year on his appointment
to the archdeaconry of Canterbury,<a id="Anchor_1292" href="#Footnote_1292" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1292.">[1292]</a> an office which
was accounted the highest ecclesiastical dignity in England
after those of the bishops and abbots.<a id="Anchor_1293" href="#Footnote_1293" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1293.">[1293]</a> He felt, however,
no vocation and no taste for the duties of sacred ministry,
and was only too glad to “put off the deacon” and fling
all his energies into the more congenial sphere of court life.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421">421</a></span><a id="Anchor_1294" href="#Footnote_1294" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1294.">[1294]</a>
Alike in its business and in its pleasures he was thoroughly
at home. His refined sensibilities, his romantic imagination,
revelled in the elegance and splendour which to Henry’s
matter-of-fact disposition were simply irksome; he gladly
took all the burthen of state ceremonial as well as of state
business upon his own shoulders; and he bore it with an
easy grace which men never wearied of admiring. One day
he would be riding in coat of mail at the head of the royal
troops, the next he would be dispensing justice in the king’s
name;<a id="Anchor_1295" href="#Footnote_1295" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1295.">[1295]</a> and his will was law throughout the land, for all
men knew that his will and Henry’s were one.<a id="Anchor_1296" href="#Footnote_1296" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1296.">[1296]</a></p>

<p>In outward aspect Thomas must have been far more
regal than the king himself. He was very tall and elegantly
formed,<a id="Anchor_1297" href="#Footnote_1297" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1297.">[1297]</a> with an oval face,<a id="Anchor_1298" href="#Footnote_1298" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1298.">[1298]</a> handsome aquiline features,<a id="Anchor_1299" href="#Footnote_1299" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1299.">[1299]</a> a
lofty brow,<a id="Anchor_1300" href="#Footnote_1300" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1300.">[1300]</a> large, lustrous and penetrating eyes;<a id="Anchor_1301" href="#Footnote_1301" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1301.">[1301]</a> there was
an habitual look of placid dignity in his countenance,<a id="Anchor_1302" href="#Footnote_1302" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1302.">[1302]</a> a
natural grace in his every gesture, an ingrained refinement
in his every word and action;<a id="Anchor_1303" href="#Footnote_1303" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1303.">[1303]</a> the slender, tapering, white
fingers<a id="Anchor_1304" href="#Footnote_1304" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1304.">[1304]</a> and dainty attire of the burgher’s son contrasted
curiously with the rough brown hands and careless appearance
of Henry Fitz-Empress; the order, elegance and
liberality of the chancellor’s household contrasted no less
with the confusion and discomfort of the king’s. The
riches that passed through Thomas’s hands were enormous;
revenues and honours were heaped on him by the king;
costly gifts poured in upon him daily from clergy and laity,
high and low. But what he received with one hand he gave
away with the other; his splendour and his wealth were
shared with all who chose to come and take a share of them.
His door was always open, his table always spread, for all<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422">422</a></span>
men, of whatever race or rank, who stood in need of hospitality.<a id="Anchor_1305" href="#Footnote_1305" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1305.">[1305]</a>
Besides fifty-two clerks regularly attached to his
household—some to act as his secretaries, some to take
charge of the vacant benefices in his custody, some to serve
his own numerous livings and prebends<a id="Anchor_1306" href="#Footnote_1306" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1306.">[1306]</a>—he had almost
every day a company of invited guests to dinner; every day
the hall was freshly strewn with green leaves or rushes in
summer and clean hay or straw in winter, amid which those
for whom there was no room on the benches sat and dined
on the floor. The tables shone with gold and silver vessels,
and were laden with costly viands; Thomas stuck at no
expense in such matters; but it was less for his own enjoyment
than for that of his guests;<a id="Anchor_1307" href="#Footnote_1307" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1307.">[1307]</a> and these always included
a crowd of poor folk, who were as sumptuously and carefully
served as the rich;<a id="Anchor_1308" href="#Footnote_1308" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1308.">[1308]</a> the meanest in his house never
had to complain of a dinner such as the noblest were often
obliged to endure in King Henry’s court, where half-baked
bread, sour wine, stale fish and bad meat were the ordinary
fare.<a id="Anchor_1309" href="#Footnote_1309" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1309.">[1309]</a> The chancellor’s hospitality was as gracious as it was
lavish. He was the most perfect of hosts; he saw to the
smallest details of domestic service; he noted the position
of each guest, missed and inquired for the absent, perceived
and righted in a moment the least mistake in precedence;
if any man out of modesty tried to take a lower place than
was his due, it was in vain; no matter in what obscure
corner he might hide, Thomas was sure to find him out; he
seemed to pierce through curtains and walls with those
wonderful eyes whose glance brightened and cheered the
whole table.<a id="Anchor_1310" href="#Footnote_1310" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1310.">[1310]</a> No wonder that barons and knights sent
their sons to be educated under his roof,<a id="Anchor_1311" href="#Footnote_1311" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1311.">[1311]</a> and that his personal
followers were far more numerous than those of the
king.<a id="Anchor_1312" href="#Footnote_1312" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1312.">[1312]</a></p>

<p>Henry might have been jealous of his minister; but
there was no thought of jealousy in his mind. He was constantly
in and out at the chancellor’s house; half in sheer
fun, half to see for himself the truth of the wonderful stories
which he heard about it, he would come uninvited to dinner,
riding up suddenly—often bow in hand, on his way to or
from the chase—when Thomas was seated at table; sometimes
he would take a stirrup-cup, nod to his friend and ride
away; sometimes he would leap over the table, sit down
and eat. When their work was over, king and chancellor
played together like a couple of schoolboys, and whether it
was in their private apartments, in the public streets, in the
palace, or in church, made no difference at all. It was a
favourite tale among their associates how as they rode together
through the streets of London one winter’s day, the
king, seeing a ragged shivering beggar, snatched at the
chancellor’s handsome new mantle of scarlet cloth lined with
vair, crying—“You shall have the merit of clothing the
naked this time!” and after a struggle in which both combatants
nearly fell off their horses, sent the poor man away
rejoicing in his new and strangely acquired garment, while
with shouts of applause and laughter the bystanders crowded
round Thomas, playfully offering him their cloaks and capes
in compensation for his loss.<a id="Anchor_1313" href="#Footnote_1313" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1313.">[1313]</a></p>

<p>It is hardly possible to deny that such enormous wealth
as passed through Thomas’s hands during his tenure of the
chancellorship must have been acquired, in part at least, by
means which in the case of a minister of the Crown in our
own day would be accounted little less than scandalous.
But in the twelfth century there was no scandal about the
matter. Costly gifts of all kinds were showered at the feet
of kings and great men openly and as matter of course, and
kings and great men received them as openly, often without
any idea of bribery on either side. Moreover it is to be
remembered that Thomas’s position as chancellor gave him
command over a considerable portion of the royal revenues,
and that he was left free to draw upon them at his own
discretion to meet an expenditure of which part was incurred<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424">424</a></span>
directly in the king’s behalf, while the whole of it might be
regarded as indirectly tending to the king’s glorification and
benefit. The two friends in fact seem to have had but one
purse as well as “one mind and one heart,” and not till
many years later was there any thought of disentangling
their accounts. Amid all the chancellor’s wild magnificence,
there is no evidence of corruption; and there was certainly
no arrogance. Thomas had nothing of the upstart in him;
he never ignored his burgher-origin, he never dropped the
friends of his boyhood; his filial submission to the primate
remained unchanged;<a id="Anchor_1314" href="#Footnote_1314" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1314.">[1314]</a> his gratitude to his early teachers
at Merton was proved by his choice of a confessor from
among them,<a id="Anchor_1315" href="#Footnote_1315" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1315.">[1315]</a> and by his successful efforts to bring their
house under the special patronage of the king.<a id="Anchor_1316" href="#Footnote_1316" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1316.">[1316]</a> His
tastes were those of the most refined aristocrat, but his
sympathies were with the people from whose ranks he had
sprung; his boundless almsgiving was doubled in value
by the gracious considerateness with which it was bestowed;
his tenderness for the poor was as genuine and
as delicate as that of his mother the good dame Rohese,
and he was quick alike to supply their needs and to
vindicate their cause.<a id="Anchor_1317" href="#Footnote_1317" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1317.">[1317]</a></p>

<p>Like the king himself, Thomas was a standing marvel to
his contemporaries; the strict stood aghast at his unclerical
mode of life; the simple were half inclined to take him for
a wizard.<a id="Anchor_1318" href="#Footnote_1318" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1318.">[1318]</a> But his witchery was universal and irresistible;
and after all it was only the magic of a winning personality,
a vivid imagination, a dauntless spirit and a guileless heart.
For the chancellor’s frivolity was all on the surface of his
life; its inner depths were pure. Amid the countless temptations
of a corrupt court, no stain ever rested upon his personal
honour. He shared in all the king’s pursuits, except

<p>His position at court was no easy one; for a while envy,
hatred and malice assailed him from all sides, and their
attacks, added to an immense load of work, so overwhelmed
him that he more than once declared to his friends and to
the primate that he was weary of his life and would be
thankful to end it, or at any rate to break away from the
bondage of the court, if only he could do so with honour.
But he was not the man to forsake a task which he had
once undertaken;<a id="Anchor_1324" href="#Footnote_1324" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1324.">[1324]</a> his nature was rather to do it, like the
king himself, with all his might. In the after-years, when
friends and foes alike could hardly look back upon any
period of Thomas’s career save in the light of the martyr’s
aureole, more than half the credit of Henry’s early reforms
was bestowed upon the chancellor.<a id="Anchor_1325" href="#Footnote_1325" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1325.">[1325]</a> Even at the time, he
was described by no mean authority as the champion of all
liberty,<a id="Anchor_1326" href="#Footnote_1326" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1326.">[1326]</a> the defender of all rights, the redresser of all wrongs,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426">426</a></span>
the restorer of peace,<a id="Anchor_1327" href="#Footnote_1327" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1327.">[1327]</a> the mediator who stood between king
and people to soften the inflexibility of law and prevent
justice from degenerating into legal wrong.<a id="Anchor_1328" href="#Footnote_1328" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1328.">[1328]</a> It is certain
that the brightest and happiest years of Henry’s reign were
those during which Thomas held the foremost rank and took
the foremost part in the administration of government. For
the successful execution of Henry’s policy, therefore, Thomas
is entitled to a large share of credit. But that he in any
serious degree influenced and moulded the general scope
of that policy is a theory opposed both to the evidence of
actual events and to the inferences which must be drawn
from the characters of the two men, as developed in their
after-careers. Thomas may have suggested individual
measures—we shall see that he did suggest one of very
great importance;—he may have contrived modifications
in detail; but Henry’s policy, as a whole, bears the clear
stamp of one mind—his own. The chancellor’s true merit
lies in this, that he was Henry’s best and most thorough
fellow-worker—not so much his counsellor or minister as
his second self. It is not hard to see why they were friends;
nor to see, too, why they were to quarrel so fatally. The
same characteristics which drew them together were fated
to part them in the end. The king found in the burgher’s
son a temper as energetic, a spirit as versatile and impetuous,
a tongue as quick and sharp,<a id="Anchor_1329" href="#Footnote_1329" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1329.">[1329]</a> a determination as resolute,
dauntless and thorough as his own, with a much less subtle
brain, a much more excitable imagination, and much more
sensitive feelings. While they moved side by side in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427">427</a></span>
same sphere, they had “but one heart and one soul”; when
once their spheres became opposed, the friends could only
change into bitter antagonists.</p>

The statement occurs in none of the extant Latin
lives, but from its very strangeness can hardly be anything but a touch of genuine
tradition. The impediment however can only have been a very slight one, and
was most likely nothing more than the effect of his extreme impetuosity. It certainly
did not hinder him speaking his mind fully and forcibly upon any important
occasion when his feelings were deeply stirred.

<p>Henry’s first manifesto was published before Thomas
entered his service. Immediately after his coronation he
issued a charter setting forth the broad principles of his
intended policy<span class="nobreak">:—</span>the restoration and confirmation of all
liberties and customs in Church and state as settled by his
grandfather.<a id="Anchor_1330" href="#Footnote_1330" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1330.">[1330]</a> The actual wording of the charter was hardly
more explicit than that of Stephen’s; but the marked
omission of all reference to Stephen was in itself a significant
indication that the return to an earlier and better order of
things was intended to be something more than a phrase.
On Christmas-day the king held his court at Bermondsey,
and with the counsel of the assembled barons set himself to
enforce at once the provisions of the treaty of Wallingford
which Stephen had proved incapable of executing. Peremptory
orders were issued for the expulsion of the Flemish
mercenaries and the demolition of the unlicensed castles.<a id="Anchor_1331" href="#Footnote_1331" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1331.">[1331]</a>
The effect was magical. The Flemings saw at once that
their day was over, and vanished like an army of spectres,
so suddenly that folk marvelled whither they could have
gone.<a id="Anchor_1332" href="#Footnote_1332" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1332.">[1332]</a> The razing of the castles was necessarily a less
rapid process, but it was accomplished without delay and
without disturbance.<a id="Anchor_1333" href="#Footnote_1333" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1333.">[1333]</a> These preliminary obstacles being
cleared out of the way, the next step was to re-assert the
rights of the Crown by abolishing the fiscal earldoms<a id="Anchor_1334" href="#Footnote_1334" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1334.">[1334]</a> and
reclaiming the demesne lands and fortresses which had passed
into private hands during the anarchy. Henry proclaimed
his determination clearly and firmly; all alienations of royal
revenue and royal property made during the late reign were
declared null and void; all occupiers of crown lands and
castles were summoned to surrender them at once, and the
charters of donation from Stephen whereby they attempted
to justify their occupation were treated simply as waste<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428">428</a></span>
paper.<a id="Anchor_1335" href="#Footnote_1335" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1335.">[1335]</a> There was one at least of the usurping barons to
whom Henry knew that he must carry his summons in person
if he meant it to be obeyed: William of Aumale, the
lord of Holderness, whose father had once aspired to the
crown, whom Stephen had made earl of York, and who
ruled like an almost independent chieftain in Yorkshire,
where he held the royal castle of Scarborough and was in
no mind to give it up. As soon as the festival season was
over Henry began to move northward; by the end of
January he was at York, and William of Aumale was at
his feet, making complete surrender of Scarborough and of
all his other castles.<a id="Anchor_1336" href="#Footnote_1336" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1336.">[1336]</a> Another great northern baron, William
Peverel of the Peak, had been scared into a monastery by
the mere rumour of the king’s approach;<a id="Anchor_1337" href="#Footnote_1337" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1337.">[1337]</a> he had been
concerned two years before in an attempt to poison Henry’s
earliest English ally, Earl Ralf of Chester; he knew that he
was a doomed man,<a id="Anchor_1338" href="#Footnote_1338" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1338.">[1338]</a> and when the king turned southward
again after receiving the surrender of Scarborough, he dared
not trust even his monastic tonsure to save him from his
doom, but fled the country and left all his fiefs to his
sovereign’s mercy.<a id="Anchor_1339" href="#Footnote_1339" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1339.">[1339]</a></p>

<p>After such an exhibition of Henry’s powers of coercion
on the two chief nobles of the north, lesser men were not
likely to venture upon defiance; the occupiers of crown lands
passed from rage to terror and dismay, and began sullenly
to make restitution.<a id="Anchor_1340" href="#Footnote_1340" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1340.">[1340]</a> The grantees of Stephen, however,
soon proved to be the least part of the difficulty. Several
of the royal fortresses were held by partizans of the Empress,
who had won them either while warring against Stephen in
her behalf, or by a grant from their imperial mistress in her
brief day of power; and they not unnaturally resented the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429">429</a></span>
king’s attempt to deprive them of what they looked upon
as the well-earned rewards of their service to his mother and
himself. Henry, however, had made up his mind that there
must be no distinction of parties or of persons; all irregularities,
no matter whence they proceeded, must be suppressed;
every root of rebellion must be cut off, and every ground of
suspicion removed.<a id="Anchor_1341" href="#Footnote_1341" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1341.">[1341]</a> Early in March he called another
council in London,<a id="Anchor_1342" href="#Footnote_1342" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1342.">[1342]</a> confirmed the peace and renewed the
old customs of the realm,<a id="Anchor_1343" href="#Footnote_1343" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1343.">[1343]</a> and again summoned all holders
of royal castles to give an account of their usurpations.<a id="Anchor_1344" href="#Footnote_1344" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1344.">[1344]</a>
The two mightiest barons of the west revolted at once;
Roger of Hereford, the son of Matilda’s faithful Miles,
hurried away from court to fortify his castles of Hereford
and Gloucester against the king, and made common cause
with Hugh of Mortemer, the lord of Cleobury and Wigmore,
who held the royal fortress of Bridgenorth. Roger was
brought to reason in little more than a week by the persuasions
of his kinsman Bishop Gilbert of Hereford;<a id="Anchor_1345" href="#Footnote_1345" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1345.">[1345]</a> Hugh
was suffered to complete his preparations for defiance while
Henry kept the Easter feast and held a great council at
Wallingford to settle the succession to the throne, first upon
his eldest child William, and, in case of William’s death,
upon the infant Henry, who was scarcely six weeks old.<a id="Anchor_1346" href="#Footnote_1346" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1346.">[1346]</a>
That done, the king marched with all his forces against
Hugh of Mortemer. He divided his host into three parts;
one division laid siege to Cleobury, another to Wigmore,<a id="Anchor_1347" href="#Footnote_1347" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1347.">[1347]</a>
and the third, commanded by Henry himself, sat down
before Bridgenorth.<a id="Anchor_1348" href="#Footnote_1348" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1348.">[1348]</a> On the spot where the spirit of feudal
insubordination, incarnate in Robert of Bellême, had fought
its last fight against Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, the same spirit, represented

fight had been useless fifty years ago; it was equally useless
now. One after another the three castles were taken, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_430">430</a></span>
on July 7 a great council met beneath the walls of Bridgenorth
to witness Hugh’s surrender.<a id="Anchor_1349" href="#Footnote_1349" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1349.">[1349]</a></p>

<p>At the opposite side of the kingdom two great barons
still remained to be dealt with. One was Hugh Bigod, the
veteran turncoat who had been seneschal to Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, and
who had (as the Angevin party believed) perjured himself to
oust Matilda from her rights, yet whose hereditary and
territorial influence had, it seems, been great enough to win
from the young king a confirmation of his earldom of Norfolk,<a id="Anchor_1350" href="#Footnote_1350" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1350.">[1350]</a>
as well as to procure him a long day of grace before
he was called upon to give up his many unlawfully-acquired
castles. The other was William of Blois, Stephen’s eldest
surviving son, by marriage earl of Warren and Surrey, to
whom the treaty of Wallingford had assigned two royal
castles, Pevensey and Norwich. The danger of leaving these
important fortresses in William’s hands was increased by the
position of Norwich, in the very midst of Hugh Bigod’s earldom;
and after a year’s delay Henry determined to put an
end to this state of things in East Anglia. Contrary to all
precedent, he summoned the Whitsuntide council of 1157 to
meet at Bury <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Edmund’s.<a id="Anchor_1351" href="#Footnote_1351" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1351.">[1351]</a> This peaceful invasion of their
territories sufficed to bring both earls to submission. William
contentedly gave up his castles in exchange for the private
estates which his father had held before he became king;
Hugh surrendered in like manner,<a id="Anchor_1352" href="#Footnote_1352" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1352.">[1352]</a> and was likewise taken
back into favour, to have another opportunity of proving his
ingratitude sixteen years later. This settlement of East
Anglia completed the pacification of the realm. Even before
this, however, as early as the autumn of 1155, peace and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_431">431</a></span>
order were so far secured that Henry could venture to think
of leaving the country. At Michaelmas in that year he laid
before his barons a scheme for conquering Ireland as a
provision for his brother William.<a id="Anchor_1353" href="#Footnote_1353" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1353.">[1353]</a> The Pope, who was

of his project;<a id="Anchor_1355" href="#Footnote_1355" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1355.">[1355]</a> and when he went over sea in

<p>In England the year of his absence was a year without
a history. Not a single event of any consequence is recorded
by the chroniclers save the death of Henry’s eldest son,
shortly before Christmas;<a id="Anchor_1357" href="#Footnote_1357" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1357.">[1357]</a> and even this was a matter of no
political moment; for, as we have seen, there was another
infant to take his place as heir-apparent. The blank in the
chronicles has to be filled up from the Pipe Roll which
once again makes its appearance at Michaelmas 1156, and
which has a special value and interest as being the most
authoritative witness to the character of the young king’s
efforts for the reorganization of the government, and to the
results which they had already produced. The record itself
is a mere skeleton, and a very imperfect one; the carefulness
of arrangement, the fulness of detail, the innumerable
touches of local and personal colour which make the
one surviving Pipe Roll of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> so precious and so
interesting, are sadly wanting in this roll of the second year
of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr>; yet between its meagre lines may be read a
suggestive, almost a pathetic story. Its very imperfections,
its lack of order and symmetry, its scantiness of information,
its brief, irregular, confused entries, help us to realize as
perhaps nothing else could how disastrous had been the
break-down of the administrative machinery which we saw<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_432">432</a></span>
working so methodically five-and-twenty years ago, and how
laborious must have been the task of restoration. Three
whole shires, Northumberland, Cumberland and Westmoreland,
send in no account at all, for they were still in the
hands of the king of Scots; in almost every shire there are
significant notices of “waste,” and a scarcely less significant
charge for repair of the royal manors. The old items reappear—the
Danegeld, the aids from the towns, the proceeds
of justice, the feudal incidents; but the total product
amounts to little more than a third part of the sum raised
in 1130; and even this diminished revenue was only made
up with the help of sundry “aids” and “gifts” (as they
were technically called), and of a new impost specially levied
upon some of the ecclesiastical estates under the name of
<i>scutage</i>.</p>

<p>The origin of this tax is implied in its title; it was
derived from the “service of the shield” (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">scutum</i>)—one of
the distinguishing marks of feudal tenure—whereby the
holder of a certain quantity of land was bound to furnish
to his lord the services of a fully-armed horseman for forty
days in the year. The portion of land charged with this
service constituted a “knight’s fee,” and was usually reckoned
at the extent of five hides, or the value of twenty pounds
annually. The gradual establishment of this military tenure
throughout the kingdom was a process which had been going
on ever since the Norman conquest; the use of the word
“scutage,” implying an assessment of taxation based on the
knight’s fee instead of the old rating division of the hide,
indicates that it was now very generally completed. The
scutage of 1156 was levied, as we learn from another
source,<a id="Anchor_1358" href="#Footnote_1358" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1358.">[1358]</a> specially to meet the expenses of a war which
Henry was carrying on with his rebel brother in Anjou.
For such a purpose the feudal host itself was obviously not
a desirable instrument. Ralf Flambard’s famous device of
1093, when he took a money compensation from the English
levies and sent it over sea to pay the wages of the Red
King’s foreign mercenaries, suggested a precedent which
might be applied to the feudal knighthood as well as to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_433">433</a></span>
national host. Its universal application might be hindered
at present by a clause in the charter of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, which
exempted the tenants by knight-service from all pecuniary
charges on their demesne lands. It was, however, possible
to make a beginning with the Church lands. These habitually
claimed, with more or less success, immunity from military
service except in the actual defence of the country; on the
other hand, now that the bishops and abbots had been made
to accept their temporalities on the same tenure as the lay
baronies, there was a fair shew of reason for compelling
them to compromise their claim by a money contribution
assessed on the same basis as the personal service for which
it was a substitute.<a id="Anchor_1359" href="#Footnote_1359" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1359.">[1359]</a></p>

<p>Such, it seems, was the origin of the great institution of
scutage. Its full developement, which it only attained three
years later, was avowedly the work of Thomas the chancellor;
whether or not its first suggestion came from him
is not so clear. At the moment no resentment seems to
have been provoked by the measure; its ultimate tendency
was not foreseen, the sum actually demanded was not great,
and the innovation was condoned on the ground of the
king’s lawful need and in the belief that it was only an
isolated demand.<a id="Anchor_1360" href="#Footnote_1360" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1360.">[1360]</a> A greater matter might well have been
condoned in consideration of Henry’s loyal redemption of
his coronation-pledges, to which the Pipe Roll bears testimony.
If the king had been prompt in resuming his kingly
rights, he had been no less prompt in striving to fulfil his
kingly duties. The work of necessary destruction was no
sooner accomplished than the work of reconstruction began
in all departments of state administration. The machinery
of justice was set in motion once again; the provincial
visitations of the judges of the king’s court were revived;
thirteen shires were visited by some one or more of them
between Michaelmas 1155 and Michaelmas 1156. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_434">434</a></span>
person most extensively employed in this capacity was the
constable, Henry of Essex:<a id="Anchor_1361" href="#Footnote_1361" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1361.">[1361]</a> the chancellor also appears in
the like character, twice in Henry’s company<a id="Anchor_1362" href="#Footnote_1362" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1362.">[1362]</a> and once in
that of the earl of Leicester.<a id="Anchor_1363" href="#Footnote_1363" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1363.">[1363]</a> Nay, the supreme “fount of
justice” itself was always open to any suitor who could be
at the trouble and expense of tracking its ever-shifting
whereabouts; not only was the chancellor, as the king’s
special representative, constantly employed in hearing causes,
but Henry himself was always ready to fulfil the duty in
person; at the most inconvenient moments—in the middle
of the siege of Bridgenorth, at the crisis of his struggle with
the Angevin rebels—he found time and patience to give
attentive hearing to a wearisome suit which had been going
on at intervals for nearly six years between Bishop Hilary of
Chichester and Walter de Lucy the abbot of Battle.<a id="Anchor_1364" href="#Footnote_1364" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1364.">[1364]</a> Hand
in hand with the revival of order and law went the revival
of material prosperity. In the dry, laconic prose of the
financial record we can find enough to bear out, almost
to the letter, the historians’ poetical version of the work
of Henry’s first two years. The wolves had fled or
become changed into peaceable sheep; the swords had
been beaten into ploughshares and the spears into pruning-hooks;<a id="Anchor_1365" href="#Footnote_1365" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1365.">[1365]</a>
and the merchants again went forth to pursue
their business, the Jews to seek their creditors, in peace and
safety as of old.<a id="Anchor_1366" href="#Footnote_1366" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1366.">[1366]</a></p>

<p>Henry returned to England soon after Easter 1157.<a id="Anchor_1367" href="#Footnote_1367" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1367.">[1367]</a>
His first step, as we have seen, was to secure the obedience
of East-Anglia. Having thus fully established his authority
throughout his immediate realm, his next aim was to assert
the rights of his crown over its Scottish and Welsh dependencies.
The princes of Wales, who had long been acknowledged
vassals of England, must be made to do homage to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_435">435</a></span>
its new sovereign; the king of Scots owed homage no less,
if not for his crown, at any rate for his English fiefs; moreover,
his title to these was in itself a disputed question.
Three English shires, Northumberland, Cumberland and
Westmoreland, had been conquered by David, nominally in
behalf of his niece the Empress Matilda, in the early years
of Stephen’s reign; Stephen, making a virtue of necessity,
had formally granted their investiture to David’s son
Henry;<a id="Anchor_1368" href="#Footnote_1368" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1368.">[1368]</a> and they were now in the hands of Henry’s son,
the young king Malcolm <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr> The story went that old King
David, before he knighted his grand-nephew Henry Fitz-Empress
in 1149, had made him swear that if ever he came
to the English throne he would suffer the king of Scots to
keep these shires in peace for ever.<a id="Anchor_1369" href="#Footnote_1369" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1369.">[1369]</a> Henry does not seem
to have denied his oath; he simply refused to keep it, on
the ground that it ran counter to his duty as king. Acting
on what his enemies declared to be his habitual principle,
of choosing to do penance for a word rather than for a
deed,<a id="Anchor_1370" href="#Footnote_1370" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1370.">[1370]</a> he declared that the crown of England must not
suffer such mutilation, and summoned his Scottish cousin to
give back to him the territory which had been acquired in
his name.<a id="Anchor_1371" href="#Footnote_1371" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1371.">[1371]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile, without waiting for Malcolm’s answer, Henry
prepared for his first Welsh war. The domestic quarrels of
the Welsh princes furnished him with an excellent pretext.
Owen, prince of North-Wales, had confiscated the estates of
his brother Cadwallader and banished him from the country;
Cadwallader appealed to King Henry, and of course found a
gracious reception.<a id="Anchor_1372" href="#Footnote_1372" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1372.">[1372]</a> A council was held at Northampton<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_436">436</a></span>
on July 17,<a id="Anchor_1373" href="#Footnote_1373" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1373.">[1373]</a> and thence orders were issued for an expedition
into North-Wales. The force employed was the feudal levy,
but in a new form; instead of calling out the whole body
of knights to serve their legal term of forty days, Henry required
every two knights throughout England to join in
equipping a third<a id="Anchor_1374" href="#Footnote_1374" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1374.">[1374]</a>—no doubt for a threefold term of service.
By this expedient he obtained a force quite sufficient for his
purpose, guarded against the risk of its breaking up before
its task was accomplished—a frequent drawback in medieval
warfare—and made the first innovation upon the strict rule
of feudal custom in such a manner as to avoid all offence.</p>

<p>The invasion was to be twofold, by land and sea.<a id="Anchor_1375" href="#Footnote_1375" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1375.">[1375]</a> The
host assembled near Chester,<a id="Anchor_1376" href="#Footnote_1376" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1376.">[1376]</a> on Saltney marsh,<a id="Anchor_1377" href="#Footnote_1377" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1377.">[1377]</a> and was
joined by Madoc Ap Meredith, prince of Powys. Owen of
North-Wales, with his three sons and all his forces, entrenched
himself at Basingwerk.<a id="Anchor_1378" href="#Footnote_1378" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1378.">[1378]</a> The king, with his youthful
daring,<a id="Anchor_1379" href="#Footnote_1379" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1379.">[1379]</a> set off at once by way of the sea-coast, hoping
to fall upon the Welsh at unawares; Owen’s sons however
were on the watch,<a id="Anchor_1380" href="#Footnote_1380" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1380.">[1380]</a> and in the narrow pass of Consilt<a id="Anchor_1381" href="#Footnote_1381" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1381.">[1381]</a> the
English suddenly found themselves face to face with the foe.
Entangled in the woody, marshy ground, they were easily
routed by the nimble light-armed Welsh;<a id="Anchor_1382" href="#Footnote_1382" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1382.">[1382]</a> and a cry that
the king himself had fallen caused the constable, Henry of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_437">437</a></span>
Essex, to drop the royal standard and fly in despair. Henry
of Anjou soon shewed himself alive, rallied his troops, and
almost, like his ancestor Fulk at Conquereux, turned the
defeat into a victory;<a id="Anchor_1383" href="#Footnote_1383" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1383.">[1383]</a> for he cut his way through the Welsh
ambushes with such vigour that Owen judged it prudent to
withdraw from Basingwerk and seek a more inaccessible
retreat.<a id="Anchor_1384" href="#Footnote_1384" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1384.">[1384]</a> Cutting down the woods and clearing the roads
before him, Henry pushed on to Rhuddlan, and there fortified
the castle.<a id="Anchor_1385" href="#Footnote_1385" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1385.">[1385]</a> Meanwhile the fleet had sailed<a id="Anchor_1386" href="#Footnote_1386" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1386.">[1386]</a> under the
command of Madoc Ap Meredith.<a id="Anchor_1387" href="#Footnote_1387" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1387.">[1387]</a> It touched at Anglesey
and there landed a few troops whose sacrilegious behaviour
brought upon them such vengeance from the outraged
islanders<a id="Anchor_1388" href="#Footnote_1388" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1388.">[1388]</a> that their terrified comrades sailed back at once
to Chester, where they learned that the war was ended.<a id="Anchor_1389" href="#Footnote_1389" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1389.">[1389]</a>
Owen, in terror of being hemmed in between the royal army
and the fleet, sent proposals for peace, reinstated his banished
brother,<a id="Anchor_1390" href="#Footnote_1390" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1390.">[1390]</a> performed his own homage to King Henry,<a id="Anchor_1391" href="#Footnote_1391" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1391.">[1391]</a> and
gave hostages for his loyalty in the future.<a id="Anchor_1392" href="#Footnote_1392" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1392.">[1392]</a> As the South-Welsh
princes were all vassals of North-Wales, Owen’s submission
was equivalent to a formal acknowledgement of
Henry’s rights as lord paramount over the whole country,
and the young king was technically justified in boasting
that he had subdued all the Welsh to his will.<a id="Anchor_1393" href="#Footnote_1393" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1393.">[1393]</a></p>

<p>It was doubtless on his triumphant return that the king
of Scots came to meet him at Chester.<a id="Anchor_1394" href="#Footnote_1394" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1394.">[1394]</a> Whichever of the
royal kinsmen might have the better cause, Malcolm now
clearly perceived that the power to maintain it was all on
Henry’s side. He therefore surrendered the three disputed
shires,<a id="Anchor_1395" href="#Footnote_1395" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1395.">[1395]</a> with the fortresses of Newcastle, Bamborough and
Carlisle,<a id="Anchor_1396" href="#Footnote_1396" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1396.">[1396]</a> and acknowledged himself the vassal of the English
king “in the same manner as his grandfather had been the
man of King Henry the Elder.”<a id="Anchor_1397" href="#Footnote_1397" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1397.">[1397]</a> The precise import of this
formula is uncertain, and was probably not much less so at
the time; the exact nature and grounds of the Scottish
homage to England formed a question which both parties
usually found it convenient to leave undetermined.<a id="Anchor_1398" href="#Footnote_1398" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1398.">[1398]</a> For
Henry’s present purpose it sufficed that, on some ground or

The Scottish theory seems to be that Malcolm did homage for the earldom
of Huntingdon, which had lapsed on his father’s death, and which
    <cite><abbr title="William of Newburgh">Will. Newb.</abbr> (as above, <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 106)</cite> and
    <cite><abbr title="Robert of Torigni">Rob. Torigni</abbr> (a. 1157)</cite>
say was now granted afresh to him.
But, on the one hand, the treatise “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">De Judithâ uxore Waldevi comitis</span>” in
    <cite><i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chroniques Anglo-Normandes</i> (Francisque Michel, <abbr title="volume 2">vol. ii.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 128)</cite> says that
Huntingdon was not granted to Malcolm till 1159; and on the other, the terms
of homage as stated by the
    <cite><abbr title="Chronica de Mailros" lang="la" xml:lang="la">Chron. Mailros</abbr></cite>
exclude Huntingdon, which was
granted to Henry of Scotland not by Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> but by Stephen. The truth probably lurks in
another phrase of
    <cite><abbr title="Robert of Torigni">Rob. Torigni</abbr> (a. 1157)</cite>,
which says that Malcolm surrendered,
besides the three fortresses above-named, Edinburgh “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">et comitatum Lodonensem</span>.”
This can only mean that he made a surrender of Lothian, to receive its investiture
again on the same terms as his forefathers—<i>i.e.</i> as a fief of the English Crown.
Huntingdon appears in the Pipe Rolls of 1156, 1157 and 1158, but without
mention of its third penny.

<p>The closing feast of the year was celebrated with a
brilliant gathering of the court at Lincoln. More cautious
than his predecessor, Henry did not venture to defy local
tradition by appearing in his regal insignia within the city
itself; he wore his crown on Christmas day, not in the great
minster on the hill-top, but in the lesser church of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_439">439</a></span>
in the suburb of Wigford beyond the river.<a id="Anchor_1399" href="#Footnote_1399" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1399.">[1399]</a> Next Easter
the king and queen went through this ancient solemnity of
the “crown-wearing” together, and for the last time, in
Worcester cathedral. When the moment came for making
their oblations, they laid their crowns upon the altar and
vowed never to wear them again.<a id="Anchor_1400" href="#Footnote_1400" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1400.">[1400]</a> The motive for this
renunciation was probably nothing more than Henry’s impatience
of court pageantry; but the practice thus solemnly
forsaken was not revived, save once under very exceptional
circumstances in the middle of the next reign, till the connexion
between England and Anjou was on the eve of dissolution;
and as it happens, the abandonment of this custom
of Old-English royalty marks off one of the lesser epochs in
Henry’s career. He was about to plunge into a sea of continental
politics and wars which kept him altogether away
from his island-realm for six years, and from which he never
again thoroughly emerged. This last crown-wearing at
Worcester serves as a fitting point at which we may leave
our own country for a while and glance once more at the
history of the lands united with her beneath the sceptre of
the Angevin king.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Formidable</span> as was the task of England’s internal reorganization,
it was but a small part of the work which lay
before Henry Fitz-Empress. His accession brought the
English Crown into an entirely new relation with the world
at large. The realm which for ages had been counted
almost as a separate sphere, whose insularity had been
strong enough to survive even the Norman conquest and to
turn the conqueror’s own native land into a dependency of
the conquered island, suddenly became an unit in a vast
group of states gathered into the hands of a single ruler, and
making up altogether the most extensive and important
empire in Christendom. Among the earlier kings of England
Cnut is the only one whose dominions were at all comparable
in extent to those of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> But the empire of
Cnut and that of Henry differed widely in character and
circumstances. Cnut’s northern empire was to a certain
extent homogeneous; its members had at least one thing in
common besides their common allegiance—they were all,
geographically and politically, almost as completely severed
from the rest of Europe as England herself. It was only as
an indirect consequence partly of his territorial power, but
still more of his personal greatness, that Cnut and his realms
came into connexion with central and southern Europe. In
Henry’s case, on the contrary, such a connexion was rendered
inevitable by the geographical position of his continental<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_441">441</a></span>
territories. They lay in the very heart of western
Christendom; they covered the largest and some of the
fairest regions of Gaul; they positively surrounded on two
sides the domains of the French Crown to which they owed
a nominal homage; they touched the borders of Spain, and
they went very near to those old Burgundian lands which
formed the south-western march of Germany and the north-western
march of Italy. Again, Cnut’s territories were all
perfectly independent of any ruler save himself; no rival
power disputed his claims to any one of them; no other
sovereign had any pretension to receive homage from him.
Henry, on the other hand, was by the possession of his
Gaulish fiefs placed in direct personal connexion with the
French king who was not merely his neighbour but also
his overlord. A like connexion had indeed existed between
the Norman kings of England and the French
kings as overlords of Normandy. But Henry’s relations
with France were far more complex and fraught with far
weightier political consequences than those of his Norman
predecessors. He held under the king of France not a
single outlying province, but—at the lowest reckoning—not
less than five separate fiefs, all by different titles and upon
different tenures, which were yet further complicated by the
intricate feudal and political relations of these fiefs one with
another.</p>

<p>Normandy was the least puzzling member of the group;
Henry had inherited it from his mother, and held it on the
same tenure as all her ancestors from Hrolf downwards.
About Anjou, again—the original patrimony of the heirs of
Fulk the Red—there could hardly be any question; and
the old dispute whether Maine should count as an independent
fief of the Crown or as an underfief of Normandy or of
Anjou was not likely to be of any practical consequence
when the immediate ruler of all three counties was one and
the same. Yet all these had to be treated as separate states;
each must have its special mention in the homage done by
Henry to Louis; each must be governed according to its
own special customs and institutions. So, too, must the
other appendage of Anjou—Touraine, for which homage<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_442">442</a></span>
was still owed to the count of Blois, and where he still possessed
a few outlying lands which might easily be turned
into bones of contention should he choose to revive the
ancient feud. Lastly, over and above all this bundle of
family estates inherited from his father and his mother, Henry’s
marriage had brought him the duchy of Aquitaine<span class="nobreak">:—</span>that is,
the immediate possession of the counties of Poitou and
Bordeaux; the overlordship of a crowd of lesser counties
and baronies which filled up the remaining territory between
the Loire and the Pyrenees; and a variety of more or less
shadowy claims over all the other lands which had formed
part of the old Aquitanian kingdom, and whose feudal relations
with each other, with Poitou and with the Crown of
France were in a state of inextricable confusion<span class="nobreak">:—</span>added to
which, there was a personal complication caused by the two
marriages of Eleanor, whereby her second husband owed
homage to the first for the territories which he held in
her name. Without going further into the details of the
situation, we can easily see that it was crowded with difficulties
and dangers, and that it would require the utmost
care, foresight and self-restraint on the part of both Henry
and Louis to avoid firing, at some point or other, a train
which might produce an explosion disastrous to both
alike.</p>

<p>Henry’s chief assistant in the management of his continental
affairs was his mother, the Empress Matilda. Still
closer to his side, indeed, stood one who in after-years shewed
herself gifted with far greater administrative sagacity, and
who had already acquired considerable political experience
as queen of France and duchess of Aquitaine. As yet,
however, Henry was likely to derive less assistance from the
somewhat dangerously quick wit of his wife than from the
mature wisdom of his mother. Matilda had been a harsh,
violent, impracticable woman; but there was in her character
an element of moral and intellectual grandeur which even in
her worst days had won and kept for her the devotion of
men like Miles of Hereford and Brian Fitz-Count, and which
now in her latter years had fairly gained the mastery over
her less admirable qualities. She had inherited a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_443">443</a></span>
share of her father’s talents for government; she had
indeed failed to use them in her own behalf, but she had
learned from her failure a lesson which enabled her to contribute
not a little, by warnings and suggestions, to the
success of her son. In England, where the haughtiness of
her conduct had never been forgiven, whatever was found
amiss in Henry’s seems to have been popularly laid to her
charge.<a id="Anchor_1401" href="#Footnote_1401" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1401.">[1401]</a> In Normandy, however, she was esteemed far
otherwise. From the time of her son’s accession to the
English crown she lived quietly in a palace which her
father had built hard by the minster of Notre-Dame-des-Prés,
outside the walls of Rouen;<a id="Anchor_1402" href="#Footnote_1402" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1402.">[1402]</a> taking no direct share
in politics, but universally held in profound respect by
reason of her dignified and pious life, and of the influence
which she was known to exercise upon the mind and
policy of the young duke. His first step on the tidings
of Stephen’s death had been to hold a consultation with
her; so long as she lived, her opinions and her wishes
were an element never absent from his calculations before
entering upon any serious undertaking; and if he did not
formally leave her as regent of the Norman duchy, yet
he trusted in great measure to her for the maintenance
of its tranquillity and order during his own absence beyond
the sea.</p>

<p>A personal visit was, however, necessary to make sure
of his ground with the king of France. As soon, therefore,
as matters in England were sufficiently composed, early in
1156 Henry went to Normandy;<a id="Anchor_1403" href="#Footnote_1403" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1403.">[1403]</a> Louis came to meet him
on the border, and shortly afterwards, at a second meeting,
received a repetition of his homage for all his French fiefs,
including the duchy of Aquitaine.<a id="Anchor_1404" href="#Footnote_1404" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1404.">[1404]</a> It was time; for to
every one of those fiefs, except Aquitaine and Normandy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_444">444</a></span>
there was a rival claimant in the person of his brother.
The story went that Geoffrey Plantagenet as he lay dying
at Château-du-Loir had made the bishops and barons around
his bed promise that they would not suffer him to be laid in
the grave till his eldest son had sworn to abide by the contents
of a will which he had just executed. When they
called upon Henry to take the oath, he hesitated a long
while; at last, seeing no other means of getting his father
buried in peace, with a burst of tears he swore as he was
required. After the funeral the will was read; and Henry
found himself thereby pledged to make over the whole of
his patrimonial territories—Anjou, Touraine and Maine—to
his brother Geoffrey, as soon as the addition of the
English crown to his Norman coronet should put him in
complete possession of his mother’s heritage. Till then
Geoffrey was to be content with three castles, Chinon, Loudun
and Mirebeau. For the moment Henry dissembled his
vexation; the contingency contemplated in the will was still
in the unknown future. But before it came to pass Geoffrey,
as we have seen, provoked his brother’s ill-will by using his
three castles as a basis of rebellion. Henry on his part
sought and obtained a papal absolution from the extorted
oath, and flatly refused to keep it.<a id="Anchor_1405" href="#Footnote_1405" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1405.">[1405]</a> Hereupon Geoffrey
again began stirring up a revolt whose suppression was one
of the chief objects of Henry’s visit to the continent in 1156.
The brothers met at Rouen, but they could not agree;
Geoffrey hurried back to fortify his three castles, and Henry
followed to besiege them.<a id="Anchor_1406" href="#Footnote_1406" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1406.">[1406]</a> The troops which he employed
were, as we have already seen, mercenaries paid out of the
proceeds of a scutage levied in England; and if the chancellor’s
share in the matter amounted to nothing more than
the suggestion of this contrivance, its perfect success in every
way would be enough to justify the statement of a contemporary,
that Henry <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_445">445</a></span>“profited greatly by his assistance.”<a id="Anchor_1407" href="#Footnote_1407" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1407.">[1407]</a>
Loudun and Mirebeau were successively besieged and taken;<a id="Anchor_1408" href="#Footnote_1408" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1408.">[1408]</a>
and in July the fall of Geoffrey’s last and mightiest fortress,
Chinon, brought him to complete surrender of all his claims,
for which he accepted a compensation in money from his
brother.<a id="Anchor_1409" href="#Footnote_1409" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1409.">[1409]</a> Next month Queen Eleanor came over to share
her husband’s triumph;<a id="Anchor_1410" href="#Footnote_1410" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1410.">[1410]</a> she doubtless accompanied him in
a progress through Aquitaine, where he received homage
from the vassals of the duchy, took hostages for their
fidelity,<a id="Anchor_1411" href="#Footnote_1411" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1411.">[1411]</a> and kept Christmas at Bordeaux.<a id="Anchor_1412" href="#Footnote_1412" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1412.">[1412]</a> Every part of
his continental dominions was thus thoroughly secured before
he returned to England in the spring of 1157.<a id="Anchor_1413" href="#Footnote_1413" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1413.">[1413]</a></p>

<p>Henry and Eleanor had now two children living. The

by his father’s name, had already been recognized as his
heir; the second was a girl, born in 1156,<a id="Anchor_1415" href="#Footnote_1415" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1415.">[1415]</a> and named after
her grandmother the Empress Matilda. A third, Richard,

<p>Never, since Haroun-al-Raschid sent his envoys to
Charles the Great, had such an embassy been seen in
western Europe. Thomas made up his mind to display
before the eyes of astonished France all the luxury and
splendour which the wealth of the island-realm could procure,
that King Henry might be glorified in his representative.<a id="Anchor_1421" href="#Footnote_1421" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1421.">[1421]</a>
The six ships with which he habitually crossed the
Channel<a id="Anchor_1422" href="#Footnote_1422" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1422.">[1422]</a>—the king himself had but one for this purpose,
till his chancellor presented him with three more<a id="Anchor_1423" href="#Footnote_1423" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1423.">[1423]</a>—can hardly
have sufficed for the enormous train which he took with him
on this occasion. It comprized, in the first place, some two
hundred members of his household, knights, clerks, stewards,
servants, squires, and young pages of noble blood, all provided
with horses and fitted out with new and gay attire as
beseemed their several degrees. Thomas himself had twenty-four
changes of raiment, most of which he gave away in the
course of his journey; besides a quantity of rich silks, rare
furs, and costly cloths and carpets, “fit to adorn the sleeping-chamber
of a bishop.” He had a right royal train of
coursing-dogs and hawks of all kinds. Above all, he had
eight mighty chariots, each drawn by five horses equal to
war-chargers in beauty and strength; beside each horse ran
a stalwart and gaily-clad youth, and each chariot had its
special conductor. Two of these vehicles were laden with
casks of ale, to be given to the French, who marvelled at the
beverage, strange to them, which the English thought
superior to wine. The other chariots bore the furniture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_447">447</a></span>
of the chancellor’s chapel, of his private chamber, and of his
kitchen; others again contained treasure, provisions for the
journey, necessaries of the toilet, trappings and baggage of
all kinds. Next, there were twelve sumpter-horses, of which
eight were loaded with coffers containing the gold and silver
vessels of the chancellor’s household, vases, ewers, goblets,
bowls, cups, flagons, basins, salt-cellars, spoons, plates and
dishes. Other chests and packages held the money for
daily expenses and gifts, the chancellor’s own clothes, and
his books. One pack-horse, which always went first, bore
the sacred vessels, altar-ornaments and books belonging to
the chapel. To each horse there was a well-trained groom;
to each chariot was fastened a dog, large, strong and “terrible
as a lion or a bear”; and on the top of every chariot sat
a monkey. The procession travelled along the road in
regular order; first came the foot-pages, to the number of
about two hundred and fifty, in groups of six, ten or more,
“singing together in their native tongue, after the manner of
their country.” They were followed at a little distance by
the coursing-dogs and hounds coupled and in leashes under
the charge of their respective keepers. Next, the great
chariots covered with hides came heavily rolling and rattling
along; after them trotted the pack-horses, each with a
groom; these again were followed by the squires, bearing
the shields and leading the chargers of the knights; then
came a crowd of other attendants, pages, and those who had
charge of the hawks; then the sewers and other servants of
the chancellor’s household; then his knights and his clerks,
all riding two and two; and lastly, amid a select group of
friends, the chancellor himself. In every town and village
along the road the French rushed out to inquire the meaning
of such a startling procession, and when told that it was the
chancellor of the king of England coming on a mission to the
king of France, exclaimed: “If this is the chancellor, what
must his master be?”</p>

<p>Immediately after landing Thomas notified his arrival to
Louis; at Meulan he received an answer, fixing a day for
an audience in Paris. It was the custom of the French
kings to provide at their own expense for every man who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_448">448</a></span>
came to their court during his sojourn there; Louis therefore
issued a proclamation in Paris forbidding the sale of any
article whatsoever to the chancellor or his attendants.
Thomas however was resolved to decline the royal hospitality;
he sent his caterers in disguise and under feigned names to
all the fairs round about—Lagny, Corbeil, Pontoise, <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Denys—where they bought up such an abundance of bread,
meat, fish and wine that when he reached his lodging at the
Temple he found it stocked with three days’ provisions for a
thousand men. One dish of eels, which had cost a hundred
shillings sterling, was long remembered as an instance of the
English chancellor’s prodigality. Every possible courtesy was
interchanged between him and the French king. Every member
of the court, were he count, baron, knight or serving-man,
received some token of insular wealth and generosity; Thomas
gave away all his gold and silver plate, all his costly raiment;
to one a cloak, to another a fur cape, to another a pelisse,
to another a palfrey or a destrier.<a id="Anchor_1424" href="#Footnote_1424" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1424.">[1424]</a> The masters and scholars
of the university came in for their share; the chancellor’s
gracious reception of them, and of the citizens with whom the
English scholars lodged,<a id="Anchor_1425" href="#Footnote_1425" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1425.">[1425]</a> was a marked feature in his visit to
Paris.<a id="Anchor_1426" href="#Footnote_1426" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1426.">[1426]</a> The embassy was successful; Louis promised his
daughter’s hand to the heir of England, and Thomas went
home in triumph, having finished up his expedition by capturing
and casting into prison at Neufmarché a certain Guy of
Laval whose lawless depredations were a continual insult to
King Henry and a continual terror to his subjects.<a id="Anchor_1427" href="#Footnote_1427" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1427.">[1427]</a> Henry
himself soon afterwards went over sea, partly, no doubt, to
confirm the family alliance thus concluded with Louis. But
there was also another reason which urgently required his
presence in Gaul.</p>

<p>A fresh opening had presented itself to the ambition of
the Angevin house in a quarter where they seem to have had
no dealings since the time of Geoffrey Martel, but which
was intimately associated with their earliest traditions and
with the very foundations of their power. The long rivalry<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_449">449</a></span>
between the counts of Nantes and of Rennes had ended,
like that between the dukes of Normandy and the counts of
Anjou, in a marriage, and for eighty-two years all Britanny
had been united beneath the immediate and undisputed sway
of the one ducal house, when in 1148 Duke Conan <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> on
his death-bed disavowed the young Hoel who had hitherto
passed as his son and heir.<a id="Anchor_1428" href="#Footnote_1428" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1428.">[1428]</a> The duchy split up into factions
once again; the greater part accepted the rule of
Count Eudo of Porhoët, who was married to Conan’s only
daughter Bertha; the people of Nantes alone, fired with
their old spirit of independence and opposition, opened their
gates to Hoel and acknowledged him as their count. Hoel
however proved unable to cope with the superior forces of
his rival; at the end of eight years his people grew hopeless
of maintaining their independence under him. Rather than
give it up once more to those whom they looked upon as
representatives of the hated supremacy of Rennes, they fell
back upon their old traditional alliance with Anjou, and
having driven out the unfortunate Hoel, offered themselves
and their country to young Geoffrey Plantagenet.<a id="Anchor_1429" href="#Footnote_1429" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1429.">[1429]</a> Geoffrey,
smarting under the defeat which he had just sustained at
his brother’s hands in Anjou, was naturally delighted with
this new acquisition, and all the more as he had a fair
prospect of enjoying it in peace; for Eudo at that very
moment was suddenly confronted by another rival. Earl
Conan of Richmond, Bertha’s son by a former marriage,
being now grown to manhood, came over from England in
this same summer of 1156 to claim the heritage which
his stepfather had usurped;<a id="Anchor_1430" href="#Footnote_1430" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1430.">[1430]</a> and during the struggle
which ensued between them neither party had time or
energy to spare for dislodging the Angevin intruder from
Nantes, where he remained undisputed master for nearly
two years.</p>

Nantes was at once seized by Conan and claimed by the
king of England as heir to his childless brother;<a id="Anchor_1432" href="#Footnote_1432" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1432.">[1432]</a> and on
the eve of the Assumption Henry landed in Normandy to
enforce his claim. Before resorting to arms, however, he
deemed it prudent to secure the assent of the lord paramount
of Britanny, King Louis of France, to his intended proceedings.
The negotiations were again intrusted to the
chancellor, and again with marked success. At a conference
held on the last day of August<a id="Anchor_1433" href="#Footnote_1433" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1433.">[1433]</a> Louis did far more than
sanction Henry’s claim upon Nantes; he granted him a
formal commission to arbitrate between the competitors for
the dukedom of Britanny and settle the whole question in
dispute as he might think good, in virtue of his office as
grand seneschal of France.<a id="Anchor_1434" href="#Footnote_1434" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1434.">[1434]</a> This office was now little more
than honorary, and was held throughout the greater part of
the reign of Louis <abbr title="7">VII.</abbr> by the count of Blois; but the rival
house of Anjou seems to have also put forth a claim to it,
which Louis admitted for a moment, as on the present
occasion, whenever it suited his own purposes.<a id="Anchor_1435" href="#Footnote_1435" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1435.">[1435]</a> From<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_451">451</a></span>
Argentan, on September 8, Henry issued a summons to the
whole feudal host of Normandy to assemble at Avranches
on Michaelmas-day for an expedition into Britanny. He
himself spent the interval in a visit to Paris, where he was
entertained by Louis with the highest honours; the betrothal
of little Henry and Margaret was ratified, and the baby-bride
was handed over to the care of her future father-in-law,
who intrusted her for education to a faithful Norman
baron, Robert of Neubourg.<a id="Anchor_1436" href="#Footnote_1436" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1436.">[1436]</a> The host gathered at Avranches
on the appointed day, but only to witness Conan’s
submission. He knew that he was no match for the king
of England with the king of France at his back; so he put
himself into Henry’s hands, and received his confirmation in
the dukedom of Britanny in return for the surrender of
Nantes.<a id="Anchor_1437" href="#Footnote_1437" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1437.">[1437]</a> Henry, after a visit to the Mont-S.-Michel and a
brief halt at Pontorson to restore the castle, proceeded to
take formal possession of Nantes; he then went to besiege
Thouars,<a id="Anchor_1438" href="#Footnote_1438" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1438.">[1438]</a> whose lord was in rebellion against him. In
November he met Louis at Le Mans,<a id="Anchor_1439" href="#Footnote_1439" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1439.">[1439]</a> and thence conducted
him on a triumphal progress through Normandy. After
going through Pacy and Evreux to Neubourg, that the
French king might see his little daughter, they were received
with a solemn procession at Bec; they then visited the abbey
of Mont-S.-Michel, where Louis had a vow to pay, and from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_452">452</a></span>

Caen and Rouen safely and honourably back to his own
dominions.<a id="Anchor_1440" href="#Footnote_1440" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1440.">[1440]</a></p>

says: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Comes Carnotensis Tedbaudus despondit filiam Ludovici regis Franciæ, et

<p>The county of Nantes was in itself a very trifling addition
to the vast possessions of Henry Fitz-Empress; yet its
acquisition was a more important matter than appears at
first sight. Nantes, by its geographical position, commanded
the mouth of the Loire; its political destinies were therefore
of the highest consequence to the princes whose dominions
lay along the course of that river. The carefully planned
series of advances whereby Geoffrey Greygown and Fulk the
Black had gradually turned the whole navigable extent of
the Loire into a high-way through their own territories would
have been almost useless had they not begun by securing
the entrance-gate. To Henry, who as count of Poitou had
command of the opposite shore of the estuary, there might
have been less danger in the chance of hostility at Nantes;
but the place was, for another reason, of greater value to
him than it could ever have been to his ancestors. From
the English Channel to the Pyrenees he was master of the
entire western half—by far the larger half—of Gaul, with one
exception: between his Norman and his Aquitanian duchy
there jutted out the Breton peninsula. Britanny must have
been in Henry’s eyes something like what Tours had been
in those of Geoffrey Martel<span class="nobreak">:—</span>a perpetual temptation to his
ambition, a fragment of alien ground which must have
seemed to him destined almost by the fitness of things to
become absorbed sooner or later into the surrounding mass
from which it stood out in a sort of unnatural isolation. By
his acquisition of Nantes he had gained a footing in the
Breton duchy, somewhat as his forefathers had gained one
in the city of Tours by their canonry at <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin’s; and as
a grant of investiture from the French king had served as
the final stepping-stone to Martel’s great conquest, so the
privilege of arbitration conferred by Louis upon Henry might
pave the way for more direct intervention in Britanny. The
meaning of this autumn’s work is well summed up by Gervase<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_453">453</a></span>
of Canterbury: “This was Henry’s first step towards
subduing the Bretons.”<a id="Anchor_1441" href="#Footnote_1441" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1441.">[1441]</a> A week before the assembly at
Avranches his fourth son had been born;<a id="Anchor_1442" href="#Footnote_1442" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1442.">[1442]</a> the infant was
baptized by the name of Geoffrey. It would indeed have
been strange if the name made famous by Henry’s own
father, as well as by so many of the earlier members of the
family, had been allowed to drop out of use in the next
generation. Yet by the light of after-events one may suspect
that its revival at this particular moment had a special
reference to the memory of the lately deceased Count
Geoffrey of Nantes, and that the new-born child’s future
destiny as duke of Britanny was already foreshadowed,
however vaguely, in his father’s dreams.</p>

<p>The duchy of Aquitaine, or Guyenne, as held by
Eleanor’s predecessors, consisted, roughly speaking, of the
territory between the Loire and the Garonne. More exactly,
it was bounded on the north by Anjou and Touraine, on
the east by Berry and Auvergne, on the south-east by the
Quercy or county of Cahors, and on the south-west by
Gascony, which had been united with it for the last hundred
years. The old Karolingian kingdom of Aquitania had
been of far greater extent; it had in fact included the whole
country between the Loire, the Pyrenees, the Rhône and
the ocean. Over all this vast territory the counts of Poitou
asserted a theoretical claim of overlordship by virtue of
their ducal title; they had, however, a formidable rival in
the house of the counts of Toulouse. These represented an
earlier line of dukes of Aquitaine, successors of the dukes of
Gothia or Septimania, under whom the capital of southern
Gaul had been not Poitiers but Toulouse, Poitou itself counting
as a mere underfief. In the latter half of the tenth
century these dukes of Gothia or <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aquitania Prima</i>, as the
Latin chroniclers sometimes called them from the old Roman
name of their country, had seen their ducal title transferred
to the Poitevin lords of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Aquitania Secunda</i>—the dukes of
Aquitaine with whom we have had to deal. But the Poitevin
overlordship was never fully acknowledged by the house of
Toulouse; and this latter in the course of the following
century again rose to great importance and distinction,
which reached its height in the person of Count Raymond
<abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr>, better known as Raymond of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gilles, from the name
of the little county which had been his earliest possession.
From that small centre his rule gradually spread over the
whole territory of the ancient dukes of Septimania. In the
year of the Norman conquest of England Rouergue, which
was held by a younger branch of the house of Toulouse,
lapsed to the elder line; in the year after the Conqueror’s
death Raymond came into possession of Toulouse itself; in
1094 he became, in right of his wife, owner of half the
Burgundian county of Provence. His territorial influence
was doubled by that of his personal fame; he was one of
the chief heroes of the first Crusade; and when he died in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_455">455</a></span>
1105 he left to his son Bertrand, over and above his Aquitanian
heritage, the Syrian county of Tripoli. On Bertrand’s
death in 1112 these possessions were divided, his son Pontius
succeeding him as count of Tripoli, and surrendering his
claims upon Toulouse to his uncle Alfonso Jordan, a younger
son of Raymond of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gilles.<a id="Anchor_1448" href="#Footnote_1448" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1448.">[1448]</a> Those claims, however, were
disputed. Raymond’s elder brother, Count William <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr>,
had left an only daughter who, after a childless marriage
with King Sancho Ramirez of Aragon,<a id="Anchor_1449" href="#Footnote_1449" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1449.">[1449]</a> became the wife of
Count William <abbr title="the Eighth">VIII.</abbr> of Poitou.<a id="Anchor_1450" href="#Footnote_1450" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1450.">[1450]</a> From that time forth it
became a moot point whether the lord of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Gilles or the
lord of Poitiers was the rightful count of Toulouse. Raymond
unquestionably bore the title and exercised its functions
for some six years before his brother’s death and his
niece’s second marriage,<a id="Anchor_1451" href="#Footnote_1451" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1451.">[1451]</a> and one historian asserts that he
had acquired the county by purchase from his brother.<a id="Anchor_1452" href="#Footnote_1452" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1452.">[1452]</a>
Another story relates that William of Poitou having married
the heiress of Toulouse after her father’s death,<a id="Anchor_1453" href="#Footnote_1453" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1453.">[1453]</a> immediately
entered upon her inheritance, but afterwards pledged it to
Raymond in order to raise money for the Crusade.<a id="Anchor_1454" href="#Footnote_1454" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1454.">[1454]</a> The
reckless, spendthrift duke, whose whole energies were given
up to verse-making, discreditable adventures, and either
defying or eluding the ecclesiastical authorities who vainly
strove to check the scandals of his life, never found means
to redeem his pledge; neither did his son William <abbr title="the Ninth">IX.</abbr>,<a id="Anchor_1455" href="#Footnote_1455" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1455.">[1455]</a>
although it appears that he did at some time or other contrive
to obtain possession of Toulouse.<a id="Anchor_1456" href="#Footnote_1456" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1456.">[1456]</a> On his death, however<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_456">456</a></span>,

<p>With all these shiftings and changes of ownership the
kings of France had never tried to interfere. Southern
Gaul—“Aquitaine” in the wider sense—was a land whose
internal concerns they found it wise to leave as far as possible
untouched. It was, even yet, a land wholly distinct
from the northern realm whose sovereign was its nominal
overlord. The geographical barrier formed by the river
Loire had indeed been long ago passed over, if not exactly
by the French kings, at least by the Angevin counts. But
a wider and deeper gulf than the blue stream of Loire stood
fixed between France and Aquitaine. They were peopled
by different races, they belonged to different worlds. There
was little community of blood, there was less community of
speech, thought and temper, of social habits or political
traditions, between the Teutonized Celt of the north and
the southern Celt who had been moulded by the influences
of the Roman, the Goth and the Saracen. Steeped in
memories of the Roman Empire in its palmiest days, and
of the Gothic kingdom of Toulouse which had inherited so
large a share of its power, its culture and its glory, Aquitania
had never amalgamated either with the Teutonic
empire of the Karolings or with the French kingdom of
their Parisian supplanters. Her princes were nominal feudataries
of both; but, save in a few exceptional cases, the
personal and political relations between the northern lord
paramount and his southern vassals began and ended with
the formal ceremonies of investiture and homage. In the
struggle of Anjou and Blois for command over the policy of
the Crown, in the struggle of the Crown itself to maintain
its independence and to hold the balance between Anjou
and Normandy, the Aquitanian princes took no part; the
balance of powers in northern Gaul was nothing to them;
neither party ever seriously attempted to enroll them as
allies; both seem to have considered them, as they considered
themselves, totally unconcerned in the matter. Whatever<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_457">457</a></span>
external connexions and alliances they cultivated were
in quite another direction—in the Burgundian provinces
which lay around the mouth of the Rhône and the western
foot of the Alps, and on the debateable ground of the
Spanish March, the county of Barcelona, which formed a
link between Gascony and Aragon. The marriage of Louis
and Eleanor, however, altered the political position of Aquitaine
with respect not only to the French Crown but to the
world at large. She was suddenly dragged out of her
isolation and brought into contact with the general political
system of northern Europe, somewhat as England had been
by its association with Normandy. The union of the king
and the duchess was indeed dissolved before its full consequences
had time to work themselves out. Its first and
most obvious result was a change in the attitude of the
Crown towards the internal concerns of Aquitaine. Whether
the count of Toulouse paid homage to the count of Poitou,
or both alike paid it immediately to the Crown—whether
Toulouse and Poitiers were in the same or in different hands—mattered
little or nothing to the earlier kings whose practical
power over either fief was all bound up in the mere
formal grant of investiture. But to Eleanor’s husband such
questions wore a very different aspect. To him who was in
his own person duke of Aquitaine as well as its overlord,
they were matters of direct personal concern; the interests
of the house of Poitou were identified with those of the
house of France. For his own sake and for the sake of his
posterity which he naturally hoped would succeed him in
both kingdom and duchy, it was of the utmost importance
that Louis should strive to make good every jot and tittle
of the Poitevin claims throughout southern Gaul.</p>

<p>Four years after his marriage, therefore, Louis summoned
his host for an expedition against the count of
Toulouse.<a id="Anchor_1457" href="#Footnote_1457" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1457.">[1457]</a> It tells very strongly against the justice of the
Poitevin claims in that quarter that one of his best advisers—Theobald
of Blois—so greatly disapproved of the enterprize
that he refused to take any part in it at all;<a id="Anchor_1458" href="#Footnote_1458" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1458.">[1458]</a> and it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_458">458</a></span>
may be that his refusal led to its abandonment, for we have
no record of its issue, beyond the fact that Alfonso Jordan
kept Toulouse for the rest of his life, and dying in 1148
was succeeded without disturbance by his son Raymond <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr><a id="Anchor_1459" href="#Footnote_1459" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1459.">[1459]</a>
Four years later the duchy of Aquitaine passed with Eleanor’s
hand from Louis <abbr title="7">VII.</abbr> to Henry Fitz-Empress. Once again
the king of France became its overlord and nothing more<span class="nobreak">:—</span>his
chance of enforcing his supremacy fainter than ever,
yet his need to enforce it greater than ever, since Aquitaine,
far from sinking back into her old isolation, was now linked
together with Anjou and Normandy in a chain which
encircled his own royal domain as with a girdle of iron. In
these circumstances the obvious policy of France and Toulouse
was a mutual alliance which might enable them both
to stand against the power of Henry. It was cemented in
1154 by the marriage of Raymond <abbr title="the fifth">V.</abbr> with Constance,
widow of Eustace of Blois and sister of Louis <abbr title="7">VII.</abbr><a id="Anchor_1460" href="#Footnote_1460" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1460.">[1460]</a> Four
more years passed away; Henry’s energies were still tasked
to the uttermost by more important work than the prosecution
of a doubtful claim of his wife against the brother-in-law
of her overlord and former husband. Whether the suggestion
at last came from Eleanor herself, during the Christmas-tide
of 1158, we cannot tell; we only know that early in 1159
Henry determined to undertake the recovery of Toulouse.</p>

<p>A question now arose of what those forces were to consist.
The feudal levies of Eleanor’s duchy might fairly be
called upon to fight for the supposed rights of their mistress;
those of Anjou and Maine might perhaps be expected
to do as much for the aggrandizement of their count; but
to demand the services of the Norman knighthood for an
obscure dynastic quarrel in southern Gaul—still more, to
drag the English tenants-in-chivalry across sea and land for
such a purpose—would have been both unjust and impolitic,
if not absolutely impracticable. On the other hand, the
knights of Aquitaine were of all Henry’s feudal troops those
on whom he could least depend; and they would be moreover,
even with the addition of those whom he could muster
in his paternal dominions, quite insufficient for an expedition
which was certain to require a large and powerful host, and
whose duration it was impossible to calculate. In these
circumstances the expedient which had been tentatively and
in part adopted three years before was repeated, and its
application this time was sweeping and universal. The
king gave out that in consideration of the length and hardship
of the way which lay before him, and desiring to spare
the country-knights, citizens and yeomen, he would receive
instead of their personal services a certain sum to be levied
as he saw fit upon every knight’s fee in Normandy and his
other territories.<a id="Anchor_1465" href="#Footnote_1465" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1465.">[1465]</a> This impost, which afterwards came to
be known in English history as the “Great Scutage,” was,
as regards England, the most important matter connected
with the war of Toulouse. It marks a turning-point in the
history of military tenure. It broke down the old exemption
of “fiefs of the hauberk” from pecuniary taxation, in
such a way as to make the encroachment upon their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_460">460</a></span>
privilege assume the shape of a favour. To the bulk of
the English knighthood the boon was a real one; military
service beyond sea was a burthen from which they would be
only too glad to purchase their release; the experiment, so
far as it concerned them, succeeded perfectly, and made a
precedent which was steadily followed in after-years. From
that time forth the word “scutage” acquired its recognized
meaning of a sum paid to the Crown in commutation of
personal attendance in the host; and the specially cherished
privilege of the tenants-in-chivalry came to be not as
formerly exemption from money-payment on their demesne
lands, but, by virtue of their payment, exemption from
service beyond sea.</p>

<p>The sums thus raised in 1159 are however entered in
the Pipe Roll of the year not as scutage but under the
vaguer and more comprehensive title of <i>donum</i>. The reason
doubtless is that they were assessed, as the historians tell us
and as the roll itself shews, not only upon those estates from
which services of the shield were explicitly due, but also
upon all lands held in chief of the Crown, and all Church
lands without distinction of tenure:<a id="Anchor_1466" href="#Footnote_1466" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1466.">[1466]</a>—the basis of assessment<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_461">461</a></span>
in all cases being the knight’s fee, in its secondary
sense of a parcel of land worth twenty pounds a year.
Whatever the laity might think of this arrangement, the
indignation of the clergy was bitter and deep. The wrong
inflicted on them by the scutage of 1156 was as nothing
compared with this, which set at naught all ancient precedents
of ecclesiastical immunity, and actually wrung from
the Church lands even more than from the lay fiefs.<a id="Anchor_1467" href="#Footnote_1467" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1467.">[1467]</a> Their
wrath however was not directed solely or even chiefly
against the king. A large share of the blame was laid at
the chancellor’s door; for the scheme had his active support,
if it was not actually of his contriving. Its effects on
English constitutional developement were for later generations
to trace; the men of the time saw, or thought they
saw, its disastrous consequences in the after-lives of its
originators. In the hour of Thomas’s agony Gilbert Foliot
raked up as one of the heaviest charges against him the
story of the “sword which his hand had plunged into the
bosom of his mother the Church, when he spoiled her of so
many thousand marks for the army of Toulouse”;<a id="Anchor_1468" href="#Footnote_1468" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1468.">[1468]</a> and his
own best and wisest friend, John of Salisbury, who had excused
the scutage of 1156, sorrowfully avowed his belief
that the scutage of 1159 was the beginning of all Henry’s
misdoings against the Church, and that the chancellor’s
share in it was the fatal sin which the primate had to
expiate so bitterly.<a id="Anchor_1469" href="#Footnote_1469" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1469.">[1469]</a></p>

<p>The sum charged on the knight’s fee in Normandy was
sixty shillings Angevin;<a id="Anchor_1470" href="#Footnote_1470" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1470.">[1470]</a> in England it seems to have been
two marks.<a id="Anchor_1471" href="#Footnote_1471" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1471.">[1471]</a> The proceeds, with those of a similar tax
levied upon Henry’s other dominions,<a id="Anchor_1472" href="#Footnote_1472" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1472.">[1472]</a> amounted to some
hundred and eighty thousand pounds,<a id="Anchor_1473" href="#Footnote_1473" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1473.">[1473]</a> with which he hired
an immense force of mercenaries.<a id="Anchor_1474" href="#Footnote_1474" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1474.">[1474]</a> But his host did not
consist of these alone. The great barons of Normandy and
England, no less than those of Anjou, Aquitaine and Gascony,
were eager to display their prowess under the leadership
of such a mighty king. The muster at Poitiers was a
brilliant gathering of Henry’s court, headed by the chancellor
with a picked band of seven hundred knights of his own
personal following,<a id="Anchor_1475" href="#Footnote_1475" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1475.">[1475]</a> and by the first vassal of the English
Crown, King Malcolm of Scotland,<a id="Anchor_1476" href="#Footnote_1476" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1476.">[1476]</a> who came, it seems, to
win the spurs which his cousin had refused to grant him
twelve months ago, when they met at Carlisle just before
Henry left England in June 1158.<a id="Anchor_1477" href="#Footnote_1477" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1477.">[1477]</a> The other vassal state
was represented by an unnamed Welsh prince;<a id="Anchor_1478" href="#Footnote_1478" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1478.">[1478]</a> and the
host was further reinforced by several important allies. One
of these was Raymond Trencavel, viscount of Béziers and
Carcassonne, a baron whom the count of Toulouse had
despoiled, and who gladly seized the opportunity of vengeance.<a id="Anchor_1479" href="#Footnote_1479" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1479.">[1479]</a>
Another was William of Montpellier.<a id="Anchor_1480" href="#Footnote_1480" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1480.">[1480]</a> The most
valuable of all was the count of Barcelona, a potentate who
ranked on an equality with kings.<a id="Anchor_1481" href="#Footnote_1481" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1481.">[1481]</a> His county of Barcelona
was simply the province which in Karolingian times had
been known as the Spanish March—a strip of land with the
Pyrenees for its backbone, which lay between Toulouse,
Aragon, Gascony and the Mediterranean sea. It was a fief
of the West-Frankish realm; but the facilities which every
marchland in some degree possesses for attaching itself to
whichever neighbour it may prefer, and so holding the
balance between them as to keep itself virtually independent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_463">463</a></span>
of them all, were specially great in the case of the Spanish
March, whose rulers, as masters of the eastern passes of the
Pyrenees, held the keys of both Gaul and Spain. During
the last half-century they had, like the lords of another
marchland, enormously strengthened their position by three
politic marriages. Dulcia of Gévaudan, the wife of Raymond-Berengar
<abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> of Barcelona, was heiress not only to
her father’s county of Gévaudan, but also, through her mother,
to the southern half of Provence, whose northern half fell to
the share of Raymond of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>-Gilles. Her dower-lands were
settled upon her younger son. He, in his turn, married an
heiress, Beatrice of Melgueil, whose county lay between
Gévaudan and the sea; and the dominions of the house of
<abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>-Gilles were thus completely cut in twain, and their
eastern half surrounded on two sides, by the territories of
his son, the present count of Provence, Gévaudan and
Melgueil.<a id="Anchor_1482" href="#Footnote_1482" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1482.">[1482]</a> The elder son of Dulcia, having succeeded his
father as Count Raymond-Berengar <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr> of Barcelona, was
chosen by the nobles of Aragon to wed their youthful queen
Petronilla, the only child of King Ramirez the Monk. He
had thus all the power of Aragon at his command, although,
clinging with a generous pride to the old title which had
come down to him from his fathers, he refused to share his
wife’s crown, declaring that the count of Barcelona had no
equal in his own degree, and that he would rather be first
among counts than last among kings.<a id="Anchor_1483" href="#Footnote_1483" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1483.">[1483]</a> A man with such a
spirit, added to such territorial advantages, was an ally to be
eagerly sought after and carefully secured. Henry therefore
invited him to a meeting at Blaye in Gascony, and secured
his co-operation against Toulouse on the understanding that
the infant daughter of Raymond and Petronilla should in due
time be married to Henry’s son Richard, and that the duchy
of Aquitaine should then be ceded to the young couple.<a id="Anchor_1484" href="#Footnote_1484" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1484.">[1484]</a></p>

<p>A last attempt to avert the coming struggle was made
early in June; the two kings met near the Norman border,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_464">464</a></span>
but again without any result.<a id="Anchor_1485" href="#Footnote_1485" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1485.">[1485]</a> Immediately after midsummer,
therefore, Henry and his host set out from Poitiers
and marched down to Périgueux. There, in “the Bishop’s
Meadow,” Henry knighted his Scottish cousin, and Malcolm
in his turn bestowed the same honour upon thirty noble
youths of his suite.<a id="Anchor_1486" href="#Footnote_1486" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1486.">[1486]</a> The expedition then advanced straight
into the enemy’s country. The first place taken was Cahors;
its dependent territory was speedily overrun;<a id="Anchor_1487" href="#Footnote_1487" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1487.">[1487]</a> and while in the
south Raymond Trencavel was winning back the castles of
which the other Raymond had despoiled him, Henry led his
main force towards the city of Toulouse itself.<a id="Anchor_1488" href="#Footnote_1488" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1488.">[1488]</a> Count and
people saw the net closing round them; they had seen it
drawing near for months past, and one and all—bishop, nobles
and citizens—had been writing passionate appeals to the king
of France, imploring him, if not for the love of his sister, at
least for the honour of his crown, to come and save one of
its fairest jewels from the greedy grasp of the Angevin.<a id="Anchor_1489" href="#Footnote_1489" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1489.">[1489]</a>
Louis wavered till it was all but too late; he was evidently,
and naturally, most unwilling to quarrel with the king of
England. He began to move southward, but apparently
without any definite aim; and it was not till after another
fruitless conference with Henry in the beginning of July<a id="Anchor_1490" href="#Footnote_1490" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1490.">[1490]</a> that
he at last, for very shame, answered his brother-in-law’s
appeal by throwing himself into Toulouse almost alone, as
if to encourage its defenders by his presence, but without
giving them any substantial aid.<a id="Anchor_1491" href="#Footnote_1491" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1491.">[1491]</a> Perhaps he foresaw the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_465">465</a></span>
result. Henry, on the point of laying siege to the city,
paused when he heard that his overlord was within it.
Dread of Louis’s military capacity he could have none;
personal reverence for him he could have just as little. But
he reverenced in a fellow-king the dignity of kingship; he
reverenced in his own overlord the right to that feudal
obedience which he exacted from his own vassals. He took
counsel with his barons; they agreed with him that the
siege should be postponed till Louis was out of the city—a
decision which was equivalent to giving it up altogether.<a id="Anchor_1492" href="#Footnote_1492" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1492.">[1492]</a>
The soldiers grumbled loudly, and the chancellor loudest of
all. Thomas had now completely “put off the deacon,” and
flung himself with all his might into the pursuit of arms.
His knights were the flower of the host, foremost in every
fight, the bravest of the brave; and the life and soul of all
their valour was the chancellor himself.<a id="Anchor_1493" href="#Footnote_1493" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1493.">[1493]</a> The prospect of
retreat filled him with dismay. He protested that Louis
had forfeited his claim to Henry’s obedience by breaking his
compact with him and joining his enemies, and he entreated
his master to seize the opportunity of capturing Toulouse,
city, count, king and all, before reinforcements could arrive.<a id="Anchor_1494" href="#Footnote_1494" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1494.">[1494]</a>
Henry however turned a deaf ear to his impetuous friend.
Accompanied by the king of Scots and all his host, he
retreated towards his own dominions just as a body of
French troops were entering Toulouse.<a id="Anchor_1495" href="#Footnote_1495" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1495.">[1495]</a></p>

<p>He had, however, conquered the greater part of the

but the task of protecting them against Raymond and Louis
together, without the support of Henry’s own presence, was
a responsibility which all his great barons declined. Two
faithful ministers accepted the duty: Thomas the chancellor
and Henry of Essex the constable.<a id="Anchor_1497" href="#Footnote_1497" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1497.">[1497]</a> Thomas fixed his
head-quarters at Cahors;<a id="Anchor_1498" href="#Footnote_1498" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1498.">[1498]</a> thence, with the constable’s aid,
he undertook to hold the country by means of his own
personal followers,<a id="Anchor_1499" href="#Footnote_1499" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1499.">[1499]</a> backed by Raymond of Barcelona, Trencavel,
and William of Montpellier.<a id="Anchor_1500" href="#Footnote_1500" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1500.">[1500]</a> He ruled with a high

(as it was called by a follower of Thomas)<a id="Anchor_1503" href="#Footnote_1503" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1503.">[1503]</a> about
bearing arms against his overlord applied only to a personal
encounter in circumstances of special delicacy; he had no
scruples in making war upon Louis indirectly, as he had
done more than once before, and was now doing not only
through Thomas but also at the opposite end of France.
The English and Scottish kings had retired from Toulouse
to Limoges, where they arrived about Michaelmas.<a id="Anchor_1504" href="#Footnote_1504" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1504.">[1504]</a> Meanwhile
Count Theobald of Blois, now an ally of Henry, was
despatched by him “to disquiet the realm of France”—that
is, doubtless, to make a diversion which should draw off the
attention of the French from Toulouse and leave a clear
field to the operations of Thomas. The French king’s
brothers, Henry, bishop of Beauvais, and Robert, count of
Dreux, retaliated by attacking the Norman frontier with
fire and sword.<a id="Anchor_1505" href="#Footnote_1505" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1505.">[1505]</a> Thomas, having chased away the enemies
across the Garonne and secured the obedience of the conquered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_467">467</a></span>
territory, hurried northward to join his sovereign,
whom he apparently followed into Normandy. There he
undertook the defence of the frontier. Besides his seven
hundred picked knights, he maintained at his own cost for
the space of forty days twelve hundred paid horsemen and
four thousand foot in his master’s service against the king
of France on the marches between Gisors, Trie and Courcelles;
he not only headed his troops in person, but also
met in single combat a valiant French knight of Trie,
Engelram by name; and the layman went down before
the lance of the warlike archdeacon, who carried off his
opponent’s destrier as the trophy of his victory.<a id="Anchor_1506" href="#Footnote_1506" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1506.">[1506]</a> The king
himself marched into the Beauvaisis, stormed Gerberoi, and
harried the surrounding country till he gained a valuable
assistant in Count Simon of Montfort, who surrendered to
him all his French possessions, including the castles of
Montfort, Rochefort and Epernon. As these places lay
directly in the way from Paris to Etampes and Orléans,
Louis found himself completely cut off from the southern
part of his domain, and was compelled to ask for a truce.
It was made in December, to last till the octave of Pentecost.<a id="Anchor_1507" href="#Footnote_1507" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1507.">[1507]</a>
Henry’s wife had now joined him; they kept Christmas
together at Falaise,<a id="Anchor_1508" href="#Footnote_1508" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1508.">[1508]</a> and Henry used the interval of
tranquillity to make some reforms in the Norman judicature.<a id="Anchor_1509" href="#Footnote_1509" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1509.">[1509]</a>
When the truce expired the two kings made a treaty of
peace,<a id="Anchor_1510" href="#Footnote_1510" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1510.">[1510]</a> negotiated as usual by the indefatigable chancellor;<a id="Anchor_1511" href="#Footnote_1511" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1511.">[1511]</a>
the betrothal of little Henry and Margaret was confirmed,
and the Vexin was settled upon the infant couple. As for
the Aquitanian quarrel, Louis formally restored to Henry
all the rights and holdings of the count of Poitou, except
Toulouse itself; Henry and Raymond making a truce for a
year, during which both were to keep their present possessions,
and complete freedom of action was left to their
respective allies.<a id="Anchor_1512" href="#Footnote_1512" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1512.">[1512]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_468">468</a></span></p>

<p>This imperfect settlement, as far as Toulouse was concerned,
advanced no further towards completion during the
next thirteen years. Henry’s expedition could hardly be
called a success; and whatever advantage he had gained
over Raymond was dearly purchased at the cost of a quarrel
with Louis. There can be little doubt that Henry had
fallen into a trap; Louis had misled him into lighting the
torch of war, and then turned against him in such a way as
to cast upon him the blame of the subsequent conflagration.
The elements of strife between the two kings could hardly
have failed to burst sooner or later into a blaze; the question
was whose hand should kindle it. In spite of Henry’s
Angevin wariness, Louis had contrived to shift upon him
the fatal responsibility; and for the rest of his life the fire
went smouldering on, breaking out at intervals in various
directions, smothered now and then for a moment, but never
thoroughly quenched; consuming the plans and hopes of its
involuntary originator, while the real incendiary sheltered
himself to the last behind his mask of injured innocence.</p>

<p>For six months all was quiet. In October the two
kings held another meeting; the treaty was ratified, and
little Henry, who had lately come over from England with
his mother, was made to do homage to Louis for the duchy
of Normandy.<a id="Anchor_1513" href="#Footnote_1513" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1513.">[1513]</a> About the same time the queen of France
died, leaving to her husband another infant daughter.<a id="Anchor_1514" href="#Footnote_1514" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1514.">[1514]</a>
Disappointed for the fourth time in his hopes of a son,
Louis in his impatience set decency at defiance; before
Constance had been a fortnight in her grave he married a
third wife, Adela of Blois, daughter of Theobald the Great,
and sister of the two young counts who were betrothed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_469">469</a></span>
the king’s own elder daughters.<a id="Anchor_1515" href="#Footnote_1515" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1515.">[1515]</a> His subjects, sharing his
anxiety for an heir, easily forgave his unseemly haste and
welcomed the new queen, who in birth, mind and person
was all that could be desired.<a id="Anchor_1516" href="#Footnote_1516" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1516.">[1516]</a> It would, however, have
been scarcely possible to find a choice more irritating to
Henry of Anjou. On either side of the sea, the house of
Blois seemed to be always in some way or other crossing
his path; in their lives or in their deaths, they were perpetually
giving him trouble. At that very time the death
of Stephen’s last surviving son, Earl William of Warren,<a id="Anchor_1517" href="#Footnote_1517" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1517.">[1517]</a> had
led to a quarrel between the king and his dearest friend.
William was childless, and the sole heir to his county of
Boulogne was his sister Mary, abbess of Romsey. This
lady was now brought out of her convent to be married by
Papal dispensation to Matthew, second son of the count
of Flanders.<a id="Anchor_1518" href="#Footnote_1518" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1518.">[1518]</a> The scheme, devised by King Henry,<a id="Anchor_1519" href="#Footnote_1519" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1519.">[1519]</a> was
strongly opposed by the bridegroom’s father,<a id="Anchor_1520" href="#Footnote_1520" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1520.">[1520]</a> and also by
Henry’s own chancellor. Thomas, somewhat unexpectedly
perhaps, started up as a vindicator of monastic discipline,
remonstrated vehemently against the marriage of a nun,
and used all his influence at Rome to hinder the dispensation;
he gained, however, nothing save the enmity of
Matthew, and a foretaste of that kingly wrath<a id="Anchor_1521" href="#Footnote_1521" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1521.">[1521]</a> which was
to burst upon him with all its fury three years later. Even
without allowing for Henry’s probable frame of mind in
consequence of this affair, the French king’s triple alliance
with the hereditary rivals of the Angevin house would
naturally appear to him in the light of a provocation and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_470">470</a></span>
a menace. The chancellor seems to have made his peace
by suggesting an answer to it.</p>

<p>One of Henry’s great desires was to recover the Vexin,
which at his father’s suggestion he had ceded to Louis in
1151 as the price of the investiture of Normandy. By the
last treaty between the two kings it had been settled that
this territory should form the dowry of little Margaret; her
father was to retain possession of it, and to place its chief
fortresses in the custody of the Knights Templars, for the
next three years, until she should be wedded to young
Henry with the consent of Holy Church; whenever that
should take place, Henry’s father was to receive back the
Vexin. In other words, the dowry was not to be paid till
the bride was married; and there was evidently a tacit
understanding, at any rate on the French side, that this was
not to be for three years at least.<a id="Anchor_1522" href="#Footnote_1522" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1522.">[1522]</a> Later in the summer two
cardinal-legates visited France and Normandy on business
connected with a recent Papal election.<a id="Anchor_1523" href="#Footnote_1523" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1523.">[1523]</a> Henry, apparently
at the instigation of Thomas,<a id="Anchor_1524" href="#Footnote_1524" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1524.">[1524]</a> persuaded them to solemnize
the marriage of the two children on November 2 at Neubourg<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_471">471</a></span>.<a id="Anchor_1525" href="#Footnote_1525" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1525.">[1525]</a>
The written conditions of the treaty were fulfilled
to the letter—the babes were wedded with the consent of
Holy Church, represented by the Pope’s own legates; and
the castles of the Vexin were at once made over to Henry by
the Templars,<a id="Anchor_1526" href="#Footnote_1526" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1526.">[1526]</a> three of whom were present at the wedding.<a id="Anchor_1527" href="#Footnote_1527" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1527.">[1527]</a>
Louis found himself thoroughly outwitted. His first step
was to banish the three Templars, who were cordially received
by Henry;<a id="Anchor_1528" href="#Footnote_1528" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1528.">[1528]</a> his next was to concert with the brothers
of his new queen a plan of retaliation in Anjou. The house
of Blois naturally resented a curtailment of the possessions
of the crown which they now hoped one day to see worn by
a prince of their own blood. Louis and Theobald accordingly
set to work to fortify Chaumont, a castle which Gelduin
of Saumur had long ago planted on the bank of the Loire
as a special thorn in the side of the Angevin counts. Henry
flew to the spot, put king and count to flight, besieged and
took the castle of Chaumont together with thirty-five picked
knights and eighty men-at-arms whom Theobald had sent
to reinforce its garrison; he then fortified Fréteval and
Amboise, and, secure from all further molestation, went
to keep Christmas with Eleanor in his native city of Le
Mans.<a id="Anchor_1529" href="#Footnote_1529" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1529.">[1529]</a></p>

<p>A year of peace followed: Henry spent the greater part
of it in Normandy, garrisoning the castles of the duchy,
strengthening its newly-recovered border-fortresses, providing
for the restoration of the old royal strongholds and the
erection of new ones in all parts of his dominions, and
superintending the repair of his palace at Rouen, the making
of a park at Quévilly, and the foundation of an hospital for
lepers at Caen.<a id="Anchor_1530" href="#Footnote_1530" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1530.">[1530]</a> The chancellor was still at his side, and
had lately, as a crowning mark of his confidence, been
intrusted with the entire charge of his eldest son. Thomas
received the child into his own household, to educate him<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_472">472</a></span>
with the other boys of noble birth who came to learn courtly
manners and knightly prowess in that excellent school; he
playfully called him his adoptive son, and treated him as
such in every respect.<a id="Anchor_1531" href="#Footnote_1531" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1531.">[1531]</a> Little Henry was now in his seventh
year, and his father was already anxious to secure his
succession to the throne. The conditional homage which he
had received as an infant was, as Henry knew by personal
experience, a very insufficient security. Indeed, the results
of every attempt to regulate the descent of the crown since
the Norman conquest tended to prove that the succession of
the heir could be really secured by nothing short of his
actual recognition and coronation as king during his father’s
life-time. This was now becoming an established practice
in France and Germany. In England, where the older constitutional
theory of national election to the throne had never
died out, such a step had never been attempted but once;
and that attempt, made by Stephen in behalf of his son
Eustace, had ended in signal failure. Discouraging as the
precedent was, however, Henry had made up his mind to
follow it; and in the spring of 1162 he sent his boy over
sea and called upon the barons of England to do him
homage and fealty, as a preliminary to his coronation as
king.<a id="Anchor_1532" href="#Footnote_1532" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1532.">[1532]</a></p>

<p>A matter so important and so delicate could be intrusted
to no one but the chancellor. He managed it, like
everything else that he took in hand, with a calm facility
which astonished every one. He brought the child to
England, presented him to the bishops and barons of the
realm in a great council summoned for the purpose,<a id="Anchor_1533" href="#Footnote_1533" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1533.">[1533]</a> knelt at
his feet and swore to be his faithful subject in all things,
reserving only the fealty due to the elder king so long as he
lived and reigned;<a id="Anchor_1534" href="#Footnote_1534" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1534.">[1534]</a> the whole assembly followed his example,
and thus a measure which it was believed that Henry’s
personal presence would hardly have availed to carry through<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_473">473</a></span>
without disturbance was accomplished at once and without a
word of protest,<a id="Anchor_1535" href="#Footnote_1535" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1535.">[1535]</a> save from the little king himself, who with
childish imperiousness, it is said, refused to admit any reservation
in the oath of his adoptive father.<a id="Anchor_1536" href="#Footnote_1536" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1536.">[1536]</a> Henry probably
intended that the boy’s recognition as heir to the crown
should be speedily followed by his coronation.<a id="Anchor_1537" href="#Footnote_1537" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1537.">[1537]</a> This, however,
was a rite which could only be performed by the
primate of all England; and the chair of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Augustine was
vacant. Once again it was to Thomas that Henry looked
for aid; but this time he looked in vain. Thomas had
done his last act in the service of his royal friend. The
year which had passed away since Archbishop Theobald’s
death had been, on both sides of the sea, a year of almost
ominous tranquillity. It was in truth the forerunner of a
storm which was to shatter Henry’s peace and to cost Thomas
his life.</p>

<span class="ch2">THE LAST YEARS OF ARCHBISHOP THEOBALD.</span><br />

<span class="ch3">1156–1161.</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">All</span> Henry’s endeavours for the material and political revival
of his kingdom had been regulated thus far by one
simple, definite principle<span class="nobreak">:—</span>the restoration of the state of
things which had existed under his grandfather. In his own
eyes and in those of his subjects the duty which lay before
him at his accession, and which he had faithfully and successfully
fulfilled, was to take up the work of government
and administration not at the point where he found it, but
at the point where it had been left by Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> and Roger
of Salisbury: to pull down and sweep away all the innovations
and irregularities with which their work had been
overlaid during the last nineteen years, and bring the old
foundations to light once more, that they might receive a
legitimate superstructure planned upon their own lines and
built upon their own principles. In law, in finance, in general
administration, there was one universal standard of reference<span class="nobreak">:—</span>“the
time of my grandfather King Henry.”</p>

<p>But there was one side of the national revival, and that
the most important of all, to which this standard could not
apply. The religious and intellectual movement which had
begun under Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr>, far from coming to a standstill at his
death, had gone on gathering energy and strength during
the years of anarchy till it had become the one truly living
power in the land, the power which in the end placed Henry
<abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> on his throne. It looked to find in him a friend, a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_475">475</a></span>
fellow-worker, a protector perhaps; but it had no need to
go back to a stage which it had long since overpassed and
make a new departure thence under the guidance of a king
who was almost its own creation. At the very moment of
Henry’s accession, the hopes of the English Church were
raised to their highest pitch by the elevation of an Englishman
to the Papal chair. Nicolas Breakspear was the only
man of English birth who ever attained that lofty seat; and
the adventures which brought him thither, so far as they can
be made out from two somewhat contradictory accounts,
form a romantic chapter in the clerical history of the time.
Nicolas was the son of a poor English clerk<a id="Anchor_1538" href="#Footnote_1538" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1538.">[1538]</a> at Langley, a
little township belonging to the abbey of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Alban’s.<a id="Anchor_1539" href="#Footnote_1539" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1539.">[1539]</a> The
father retired into the abbey,<a id="Anchor_1540" href="#Footnote_1540" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1540.">[1540]</a> leaving his boy, according to
one version of the story, too poor to go to school and too
young and ignorant to earn his bread; he therefore came
every day to get a dole at the abbey-gate, till his father
grew ashamed and bade him come no more; whereupon the
lad, “blushing either to dig or to beg in his own country,”
made his way across the sea.<a id="Anchor_1541" href="#Footnote_1541" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1541.">[1541]</a> Another version asserts that
Nicolas, being “a youth of graceful appearance, but somewhat
lacking in clerkly acquirements,” sued to the abbot of
<abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Alban’s for admission as a monk; the abbot examined
him, found him insufficiently instructed, and dismissed him
with a gentle admonition: “Wait awhile, my son, and go to
school that you may become better fitted for the cloister.”<a id="Anchor_1542" href="#Footnote_1542" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1542.">[1542]</a>
Whether stung by the abbot’s hint or by his father’s reproofs,
young Nicolas found his way to Paris and into its
schools, where he worked so hard that he out-did all his
fellow-students.<a id="Anchor_1543" href="#Footnote_1543" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1543.">[1543]</a> But the life there wearied him as it had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_476">476</a></span>
wearied Thomas Becket; he rambled on across Gaul into
Provence, and there found hospitality in the Austin priory
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Rufus. His graceful figure, pleasant face, sensible
talk and obliging temper so charmed the brotherhood that
they grew eager to keep him in their midst,<a id="Anchor_1544" href="#Footnote_1544" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1544.">[1544]</a> and on their
persuasion he joined the order.<a id="Anchor_1545" href="#Footnote_1545" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1545.">[1545]</a> It seems that he was even
made superior of the house, but the canons afterwards regretted
having set a stranger to rule over them, and after
persecuting him in various ways appealed to the Pope to
get rid of him. The Pope—Eugene <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr>—at first refused
to hear them; but on second consideration he decided to
give them over to their own evil devices and offer their

<p>The English Church naturally hailed with delight the
accession of a pontiff who was at once one of her own sons
and a disciple of Eugene, whom the leaders of the intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_477">477</a></span>
and spiritual revival in England had come to regard
almost as their patron saint.<a id="Anchor_1552" href="#Footnote_1552" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1552.">[1552]</a> Adrian indeed shared all
their highest and most cherished aspirations far more deeply
and intimately than Eugene himself could have done. It
was in the cloisters of Canterbury that these aspirations
were gradually taking definite shape under the guidance of
Archbishop Theobald. There, beneath the shadow of the
cathedral begun by Lanfranc and completed by <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Anselm,
their worthy successor had been throughout the last ten or
twelve years of the anarchy watching over a little sanctuary
where all that was noblest, highest, most full of hope and
promise in the dawning intellectual life of the day found a
peaceful shelter and a congenial home. The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curia Theobaldi</i>,
the household of Archbishop Theobald, was a sort of
little school of the prophets, a seminary into which the
vigilant primate drew the choicest spirits among the rising
generation, to be trained up under his own eyes in his own
modes of thought and views of life, till they were fitted to
become first the sharers and then the continuators of his
work for the English Church and the English nation.
Through his scholars had come the revival of legal and
ecclesiastical learning in England; through them had come
the renewal of intercourse and sympathy with the sister-Churches
of the west; through them had been conducted
the negotiations with Rome which had led to the restoration
of order and peace; and in them, as Theobald hoped,
the Church, having saved the state, would find her most
fitting instruments for the work of reform and revival which
still remained to be done within her own borders. One by
one, as the occasion presented itself, he began to send them
forth to take independent positions in the Church or in the
world. Of the chosen three whom he specially trusted, the
first who thus left his side was John of Canterbury, who in
1153 succeeded Hugh of Puiset as treasurer of York. Next
year Theobald was able to place another of his disciples in
the northern metropolis in a far more important capacity:
he succeeded in obtaining the royal assent to the appointment
of Roger of Pont-l’Evêque as archbishop of York, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_478">478</a></span>
succession to <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> William, who had been restored by Pope
Anastasius after Henry Murdac’s death, but died six weeks
after his restoration.<a id="Anchor_1553" href="#Footnote_1553" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1553.">[1553]</a></p>

<p>Roger’s history before his entrance into the primate’s
household is so completely lost that even the rendering of
his surname is a matter of some doubt; it may have been
derived from the English town of Bishopsbridge, and if so
Roger was now going back as primate to his own native
shire; it seems however more probable that he came from
Pont-l’Evêque in Normandy.<a id="Anchor_1554" href="#Footnote_1554" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1554.">[1554]</a> He was evidently some years
older than Theobald’s other favourites, John of Canterbury
and Thomas of London; for we find him and Gilbert Foliot
quarrelling, apologizing, lecturing and forgiving each other
with an outspoken freedom and familiarity possible only
between two men of equal standing who have been friends
from their youth.<a id="Anchor_1555" href="#Footnote_1555" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1555.">[1555]</a> With Thomas Becket, on the other hand,
Roger was never upon really friendly terms; jealous, no
doubt, of the younger man who seemed likely to supersede
him in the primate’s confidence, Roger lost no opportunity
of teasing the “hatchet-clerk” (as he called Thomas, from
the nickname of the man who had first introduced him to
Theobald), and made his life so wretched that he was twice
driven to quit the archbishop’s house and take refuge with
Theobald’s brother, Walter, archdeacon of Canterbury, till
the latter smoothed the way for his return.<a id="Anchor_1556" href="#Footnote_1556" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1556.">[1556]</a> On Walter’s
elevation to the see of Rochester in 1148 his archdeaconry
was given to Roger;<a id="Anchor_1557" href="#Footnote_1557" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1557.">[1557]</a> he also held some other preferments,
all of which he was at one time in great danger of losing—most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_479">479</a></span>
likely on account of his share in the famous “swimming-voyage”
to Reims; but his friend Gilbert Foliot secured
him the protection of the Pope;<a id="Anchor_1558" href="#Footnote_1558" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1558.">[1558]</a> and the restoration of the
archbishop would naturally involve that of the archdeacon.
After six years’ tenure of his office at Canterbury Roger
was called to go up higher. Theobald had more than one
reason for desiring his archdeacon’s elevation. He wished
it for Roger’s own sake; he wished it still more for the sake
of his younger favourite, whom he longed to establish in a
position of dignity and importance, yet close to his own
side; above all, he wished it for the sake of the Church;<a id="Anchor_1559" href="#Footnote_1559" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1559.">[1559]</a>
for he naturally hoped that in leaving one of his own foremost
disciples seated on the metropolitan chair of York, he
would be leaving at least one prelate of the highest rank
firmly pledged to those schemes of ecclesiastical policy and
organization which he himself had most at heart. His
confidence in Roger was over-great. After all the disputes
about the canonical relations between Canterbury and York
which had wasted the energies of Lanfranc and embittered
the last days of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Anselm, Theobald missed his opportunity
of securing at last a full acknowledgement of Canterbury’s
superior rights, and was rash enough to consecrate Roger
without requiring from him a profession of obedience.<a id="Anchor_1560" href="#Footnote_1560" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1560.">[1560]</a> The
large-hearted primate evidently never dreamed that any
question of obedience could arise between himself and one of
his spiritual sons, or that Roger’s loyalty to him could fail to
be extended to his successor. He never discovered his mistake;
it was Roger’s old rival, and with him the English
Church, who ultimately had to bear its unhappy consequences.</p>

<p>Immediately after Roger’s consecration Thomas was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_480">480</a></span>
raised by his primate to deacon’s orders and made archdeacon
of Canterbury.<a id="Anchor_1561" href="#Footnote_1561" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1561.">[1561]</a> A few months later the accession
of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> opened the way for his advancement in another
direction. His appointment to the chancellorship involved
a great self-sacrifice on the part of Theobald; for the chancellor’s
duties—at least as conceived by Thomas, and as
Theobald had intended him to conceive them—took him not
only quite away from those of his archdeaconry and from
his primate’s side, but very often out of the country altogether;
so that Theobald in giving him up to the king had
condemned himself to pass his declining years apart from
the object of his warmest earthly affections. But the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Curia
Theobaldi</i> was by no means deserted; though it had lost its
most brilliant star, there was no lack of lesser lights to
brighten the primate’s home-circle; there was one whose
soft mild radiance, less dazzling than the glory of Thomas,
was a far truer and steadier reflex of Theobald’s own calm
and gentle spirit. Yet John of Salisbury had entered the
archbishop’s household within a comparatively recent period.
His father’s name seems to have been Reinfred;<a id="Anchor_1562" href="#Footnote_1562" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1562.">[1562]</a> his family
connexions were all in or around the city whence his surname
was derived;<a id="Anchor_1563" href="#Footnote_1563" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1563.">[1563]</a> but there is some indication that John
himself may have been born in London.<a id="Anchor_1564" href="#Footnote_1564" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1564.">[1564]</a> In the year after
the death of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> he went to study in Paris, and there
received his first lessons in dialectics from the greatest
scholar of the day—sitting at the feet of Peter Abelard,
and eagerly drinking in, to the utmost capacity of his young
mind, every word that fell from the master’s lips. Abelard
departed all too soon, and John pursued his studies for about
two years under his successors Alberic and Robert, of whom<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_481">481</a></span>
the latter, although commonly called “Robert of Melun”
from having taught with distinction in that place, was an
Englishman by birth, and will come before us again in later
days as Gilbert Foliot’s successor in the bishopric of Hereford.
It must have been precisely during those two years
that Thomas of London also was in Paris for the first time,
striving for his mother’s sake to overcome his dislike of books;
and it was possibly there that the two young Englishmen,
who must have been of nearly the same age, began to form
an acquaintance which afterwards ripened into a lifelong
friendship. And it can only have been about the same time,
and in that same wonderful meeting-place where so many of
the happiest and most fruitful associations of the time had
their beginnings, that John of Salisbury first met with
Nicolas of Langley.</p>

merchant’s clerk; Nicolas set out on the long course of
wandering which was to bring him at last to the Papal
chair; John, having as he says “steeped himself to the
finger-tips in dialectics, and moreover learned to think his
knowledge greater than it really was,” applied himself for
the next three years to the schools of the grammarians
William of Conches and Richard l’Evêque, with whom he
went over again the whole course of his previous studies,
penetrated somewhat deeper into those of the <i>quadrivium</i>
which he had begun under the direction of a German named
Hardwin, and improved some slight notions of rhetoric
which he had acquired at the lectures of a certain Master
Theodoric. His relatives were quite unable to maintain him
all this while; like all poor students of the day, he earned
his living and his college-fees by teaching others, and as he
pleasantly says “What I learned was the better fixed in my
mind, because I constantly had to bring it out for my pupils.”
One of these pupils was William of Soissons, to whom he
taught the elements of logic, “and who afterwards contrived,
as his followers say, a method of breaking down the old
strongholds of logic, producing unexpected consequences,
and overthrowing the opinions of the ancients.” John however
declined to believe in a “system of impossibilities,” for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_482">482</a></span>
which he at any rate was clearly not responsible; for he
had soon transferred his pupil to the care of one Master
Adam, an English teacher deeply versed in Aristotelian lore.
It seems just possible that this Master Adam, who was at
this time helping John in his studies not as a teacher but as
a friend,<a id="Anchor_1565" href="#Footnote_1565" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1565.">[1565]</a> was the same who many years before had stood in
a somewhat similar relation to Gilbert Foliot.<a id="Anchor_1566" href="#Footnote_1566" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1566.">[1566]</a> He may,
however, perhaps be more probably identified with Adam
“du Petit-Pont”—so called from the place where he lectured
in Paris—who in 1176 became bishop of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Asaph’s.<a id="Anchor_1567" href="#Footnote_1567" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1567.">[1567]</a>
After a while John found that with all his efforts he could
hardly earn enough to live upon in Paris; so by the advice
of his friends he determined to set up a school elsewhere.<a id="Anchor_1568" href="#Footnote_1568" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1568.">[1568]</a>
While sitting at the feet of the “Peripatetic” doctors on the
Mont-Ste.-Geneviève he had become acquainted with a
young native of Champagne, Peter by name, who was
studying in the school of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Martin-des-Champs.<a id="Anchor_1569" href="#Footnote_1569" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1569.">[1569]</a> The two
friends, it seems, settled together at Provins in Peter’s native
land, and there, under the protection of the good Count
Theobald,<a id="Anchor_1570" href="#Footnote_1570" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1570.">[1570]</a> laboured and prospered for three years.<a id="Anchor_1571" href="#Footnote_1571" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1571.">[1571]</a> Long
afterwards, from his anxious post at the side of the dying
Archbishop Theobald, John’s thoughts strayed tenderly back
to the days which he and his young comrade, with hearts as
light as their purses, had spent among the roses of Champagne:
“I am the same that ever I was,” he wrote to Peter,
now abbot of Celle, “only I possess more than you and I
had between us at Provins.”<a id="Anchor_1572" href="#Footnote_1572" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1572.">[1572]</a> He returned to Paris, revisited
his old haunts on the Mont-Ste.-Geneviève, and was amused
to find his old school-companions just where and as he had
left them. <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_483">483</a></span>“They did not seem to have advanced an inch
towards disposing of the old questions, nor to have added
one new proposition.” He, in his three years of healthy
meditation in the country, had discovered that their dialectics,
however useful as a help to other studies, were in themselves
but a fruitless and lifeless system; he therefore now gave
himself up to the study of theology under a certain Master
Gilbert, Robert “Pullus”—in whom one is tempted to
recognize the Robert Pulein who had planted the seed of
the first English University by his divinity-lectures at Oxford
in 1133—and lastly, Simon of Poissy.</p>

<p>John’s whole career in the schools, after occupying
about twelve years,<a id="Anchor_1573" href="#Footnote_1573" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1573.">[1573]</a> apparently came to an end shortly before
the council of Reims. His old friend Peter had already
retired into the peace of the cloister, and about this time
became abbot of Celle, near Troyes. There John, who was
utterly without means of living, found a shelter and a home,
nominally, it seems, in the capacity of Peter’s “clerk” or
secretary, but in reality as the recipient of a generous
hospitality which sought for no return save the enjoyment
of his presence and his friendship.<a id="Anchor_1574" href="#Footnote_1574" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1574.">[1574]</a> Such a light as John’s,
however, could not long remain thus hidden under a bushel.
So felt Peter himself;<a id="Anchor_1575" href="#Footnote_1575" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1575.">[1575]</a> and at that moment a better place
for it was easily found. At the council of Reims, or during
his exile after it, the archbishop of Canterbury probably met
the abbot of Celle and his English “clerk”;<a id="Anchor_1576" href="#Footnote_1576" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1576.">[1576]</a> he certainly
must have met the abbot of Clairvaux; and <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Bernard, with
his unerring instinct, had already discovered John’s merits.
He named him to Theobald in terms of commendation; and
it was he who furnished the letter of introduction,<a id="Anchor_1577" href="#Footnote_1577" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1577.">[1577]</a> as it was
Peter who furnished the means,<a id="Anchor_1578" href="#Footnote_1578" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1578.">[1578]</a> wherewith John at last
made his way to the archbishop’s court,<a id="Anchor_1579" href="#Footnote_1579" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1579.">[1579]</a> of which he soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_484">484</a></span>
became one of the busiest and most valued members. So
busy was he—so “distracted with diverse and adverse
occupations,” as he himself said—that he complained of
being scarce able to steal an hour for the literary and
philosophical pursuits which he so dearly loved. Ten times
in the next thirteen years<a id="Anchor_1580" href="#Footnote_1580" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1580.">[1580]</a> did he cross the Alps, twice did
he visit Apulia, on business with the Roman court for his
superiors or his friends; besides travelling all over England
and Gaul on a variety of errands, and fulfilling a crowd of
home-duties which left him scarcely time to look after his
own private affairs, much less to indulge in study.<a id="Anchor_1581" href="#Footnote_1581" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1581.">[1581]</a> The
greater part of the communications between Theobald and
Eugene <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> must have passed through his hands, either as
messenger or as amanuensis; but his name never figures in
their diplomatic history; his place therein was a subordinate
one. It was not in his nature to take the foremost rank.
Not that he was unfit for it<span class="nobreak">:—</span>with his gracious, genial
temper; his calm clear judgement, generally sound because
always disinterested; his delicate wit, his easy, elegant
scholarship, and his wide practical experience of the world—John
of Salisbury might have adorned far higher positions
in either Church or state than any which he ever actually
occupied. But his own position was a thing of which he
seems never to have thought, save as a means of serving
others. His apology for his unwilling neglect of literature—“I
am a man under authority”<a id="Anchor_1582" href="#Footnote_1582" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1582.">[1582]</a>—might have been the
motto of his life. He left it to others to lead; if they led
in the way of righteousness, they might be sure of one
faithful adherent who would serve and follow them through
good report and evil report, who would try to clear the path
before them at any risk to himself; who would criticize<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_485">485</a></span>
their conduct and tell them of their errors with fearless
simplicity, while striving to avert the consequence of those
errors and to cover their retreat; who in poverty and exile,
incurred for another’s sake, would make light of his own
sufferings and be constantly endeavouring to relieve those of
his fellow-sufferers, and who would always find or make a
silver lining to the darkest cloud. This was what John did
for the possible acquaintance of his early student-days whom
he had now rejoined in the household of Archbishop
Theobald. To the end of his life he was more than satisfied
to count the friendship of Thomas Becket as his chief title
of honour, and to let whatever share of lustre might have
been his own go to brighten the aureole of his friend. It
brightened it far more than he knew. When detractors
and panegyrists have both done their worst, there remains
this simple proof of the real worth of Thomas—that he
inspired such devotion as this in a man such as John of
Salisbury, and that he knew how to appreciate it as it
deserved.</p>

it appears that at the time of writing it John had been twelve years
at the court. As the <cite><i>Polycraticus</i></cite> was written during the war of Toulouse,
this takes us back to 1148. He must in fact have joined Theobald very soon after
the council of Reims.

but he cannot possibly have left Paris before 1147, and the <cite><i>Metalogicus</i></cite> was finished before Theobald’s death in 1161. Either there is something

<p>It was however John’s friendship with Nicolas of Langley
which in these years of his residence in the primate’s household
made him so valuable to Theobald as a medium of
communication with Rome. We can hardly doubt that this
acquaintance, too, had begun in Paris; now, as the English
cardinal-secretary and the envoy of the English primate discussed
in the Roman court the prospects of their common
mother-country and mother-Church, their acquaintance
ripened into a friendship which no change of outward circumstances
could alter or disturb. Nicolas cared more for
John than for his own nearest relatives; he declared in
public and in private that he loved him above all men
living; he delighted in unburthening his soul to him. When
he became Pope there was no change; a visit from John
was still Adrian’s greatest pleasure; he rejoiced in welcoming
him to his table, and despite John’s modest remonstrances
insisted that they should be served from the same
dish and flagon.<a id="Anchor_1583" href="#Footnote_1583" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1583.">[1583]</a> King and primate were both alike quick
to perceive and use such an opportunity of strengthening<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_486">486</a></span>
the alliance between England and Rome; while Adrian on
his part was all the more ready to give a cordial response
to overtures made to him from the land of his birth, when
they came through the lips of his dearest friend. As a
matter of course, it was John who very soon after the accession
of Henry <abbr title="the Second">II.</abbr> was sent to obtain a Papal authorization
for the king’s projected conquest of Ireland.<a id="Anchor_1584" href="#Footnote_1584" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1584.">[1584]</a> Naturally,
too, it was John who now became Theobald’s private
secretary and confidential medium of communication with
Pope Adrian. A considerable part of the correspondence
which goes under John’s name really consists of the archbishop’s
letters, John himself being merely the amanuensis.
This part of his work, however, was a relaxation which he
only enjoyed at intervals; he was still constantly on active
duty of some kind or other not only at the court of the
primate but also at that of the king; and sorely did he
long to escape from its weary trifling, to find rest for his
soul in the pursuit of that “divine philosophy” which had
been the delight of his youth.<a id="Anchor_1585" href="#Footnote_1585" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1585.">[1585]</a> But obedience, not inclination,
had brought him to court, and obedience kept him
there. Thomas knew his worth and would not let him go;
at last, to pacify his uneasiness, he bade him relieve his
mind by pouring it out in a book. John protested he had
scarce time to call his soul his own, much less his intellect
or his hands.<a id="Anchor_1586" href="#Footnote_1586" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1586.">[1586]</a> He was, however, set free by the removal of
the court over sea for the expedition against Toulouse; and
while Thomas was riding in coat of mail at the head of his
troops against Count Raymond and King Louis, John was
writing his <cite><i>Polycraticus</i></cite> in the quiet cloisters of Canterbury.<a id="Anchor_1587" href="#Footnote_1587" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1587.">[1587]</a></p>

<p>This book of <i>Polycraticus on the Triflings of Courtiers
and the Foot-prints of Philosophers</i><a id="Anchor_1588" href="#Footnote_1588" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1588.">[1588]</a> is a strange medley of
moral and political speculations, personal experiences, and
reflections upon men and things, old and new. Its greatest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_487">487</a></span>
charm lies in the revelation of the writer’s pure, sweet, child-like
character, shining unconsciously through the veil of his
scholastic pedantries and rambling metaphysics; its historical
value consists in the light which it throws on the social condition
of England with respect to a crowd of matters which
the chroniclers leave wholly in the dark. “Part of it,” says
the author in his dedication, “deals with the trifles of the
court; laying most stress on those which have chiefly called
it forth. Part treats of the foot-prints of the philosophers,
leaving, however, the wise to decide for themselves in each
case what is to be shunned and what to be followed.”<a id="Anchor_1589" href="#Footnote_1589" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1589.">[1589]</a> We
need not weary ourselves with John’s meditations upon
Aristotle and Plato and their scholastic commentators; they
all come round to one simple conclusion—that the fear of the
Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the love of Him the
end of all true philosophy.<a id="Anchor_1590" href="#Footnote_1590" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1590.">[1590]</a> It is in the light of this truth
that he looks at the practical questions of the day, and
reviews those “trifles of the court” which are really the crying
abuses of the government, the ecclesiastical administration,
and society at large. In the forefront of all he does not hesitate,
although dedicating his book to the chancellor whose

Henry’s government, still a ground of serious complaint. So,
too, was the decay of valour among the young knighthood of
the day—a consequence of the general relaxation of discipline,
first during the years of anarchy, and then in the reaction<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_488">488</a></span>
produced by the unbroken peace which England had
enjoyed since Henry’s accession. Chivalry was already falling
back from its lofty ideal; military exercises were
neglected for the pleasures and luxury of the court; the
making of a knight, in theory a matter almost as solemn as
the making of a priest, was sinking into a mere commonplace
formality;<a id="Anchor_1593" href="#Footnote_1593" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1593.">[1593]</a> and the consequences were beginning to

<p>The ills of the state had each its counterpart in the
Church; the extortions and perversions of justice committed
by the secular judges were paralleled by those of the ecclesiastical
officials, deans and archdeacons;<a id="Anchor_1597" href="#Footnote_1597" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1597.">[1597]</a> and at the bottom
of the mischief lay the old root of all evil. Simony was
indeed no longer public; spiritual offices were no longer
openly bought with hard cash; but they were bought with
court-interest instead;<a id="Anchor_1598" href="#Footnote_1598" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1598.">[1598]</a> the Church’s most sacred offices
were filled by men who came straight from the worldly life

although, in deference to public opinion, they were obliged
to go through an elaborate shew of reluctance, and Scripture
and hagiology were ransacked for examples of converted
sinners, which were always found sufficient to meet any

justify any appointment, however outrageous.<a id="Anchor_1600" href="#Footnote_1600" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1600.">[1600]</a> All the sins

<p>Over against the picture of the world and the Church
as they actually were, the disciple of Archbishop Theobald
sets his ideal of both as they should be—as the primate and
his children aimed at making them. For John’s model
commonwealth, built up in a somewhat disjointed fashion
on a foundation partly of Holy Writ and partly of classic
antiquity, is not, like the great Utopia of the sixteenth
century, the product of one single, exceptionally constituted
mind; it is a reflection of the plans and hopes of those
among whom John lived and worked, and thus it helps us
to see something of the line of thought which had guided
their action in the past and which moulded their schemes
for the future. Like all medieval theorists, they began at
the uppermost end of the social and political scale; they
started from a definite view of the rights and duties of the
king, as the head on which all the lower members of the
body politic depended. The divine right of kings, the
divine ordination of the powers that be, were fundamental
doctrines which they understood in a far wider and loftier
sense than the king-worshippers of the seventeenth century<span class="nobreak">:—</span>which
they employed not to support but to combat the
perverted theory that “the sovereign’s will has the force of
law,” already creeping in through the influence of the
imperial jurisprudence;<a id="Anchor_1602" href="#Footnote_1602" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1602.">[1602]</a>—and which were no less incompatible
with the principle of invariable hereditary succession.
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_490">490</a></span>“Lands and houses and suchlike things must needs descend
to the next in blood; but the government of a people is to
be given only to him whom God has chosen thereto, even to
him who has God’s Spirit within him and God’s law ever
before his eyes<span class="dots">...</span>. Not that for the mere love of change
it is lawful to forsake the blood of princes, to whom by the
privilege of the divine promises and by the natural claims
of birth the succession of their children is justly due, if only
they walk according to right. Neither, if they turn aside
from the right way, are they to be immediately cast off, but
patiently admonished till it become evident that they are
obstinate in their wickedness”<a id="Anchor_1603" href="#Footnote_1603" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1603.">[1603]</a>—then, and then only, shall
the axe be laid to the root of the corrupt tree, and it shall

<p>Such was the moral which the wisest and most thoughtful
minds in England drew from the lessons of the anarchy.
On a like principle, it was in the growth of a more definite
and earnest sense of individual duty and responsibility, as
opposed to the selfish lawlessness which had so long prevailed,
that they trusted for the regeneration of society.
They sought to teach the knights to live up to the full
meaning of their vows and the true objects of their institution—the
protection of the Church, the suppression of
treason, the vindication of the rights of the poor, the pacification
of the country;<a id="Anchor_1605" href="#Footnote_1605" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1605.">[1605]</a> so that the consecration of their
swords upon the altar at their investiture should be no
empty form, but, according to its original intention, a true
symbol of the whole character of their lives and, if need be,
of their deaths.<a id="Anchor_1606" href="#Footnote_1606" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1606.">[1606]</a> And then side by side with the true knight
would stand the true priest<span class="nobreak">:—</span>both alike soldiers of the
Cross, fighting in the same cause though with different
weapons—figured, according to John’s beautiful application
of a text which medieval reformers never wearied of expounding,
by the “two swords” which the Master had
declared “enough” for His servants, all the lawless undisciplined
activity of self-seekers and false brethren being<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_491">491</a></span>
merely the “swords and staves” of the hostile multitude.<a id="Anchor_1607" href="#Footnote_1607" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1607.">[1607]</a>
Into a detailed examination of the rights or the duties
of the various classes of the people no one in those days
thought it necessary to enter; their well-being and well-doing
were regarded as dependent upon those of their
superiors, and the whole question of the relation between
rulers and ruled—“head and feet,” according to the simile
which John borrows from Plutarch—was solved by the
comprehensive formula, “Every one members one of
another.”<a id="Anchor_1608" href="#Footnote_1608" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1608.">[1608]</a> To watch over and direct the carrying-out of
this principle was the special work of the clergy; and
the clerical reformers were jealous for the rights of their
order because, as understood by them, they represented
and covered the rights of the whole nation; the claims
which they put forth in the Church’s name were a protest
in behalf of true civil and religious liberty against tyranny
on the one hand and license on the other.<a id="Anchor_1609" href="#Footnote_1609" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1609.">[1609]</a> “For there
is nothing more glorious than freedom, save virtue; if
indeed freedom may rightly be severed from virtue—for

<p>How far these lofty views had made their way into the
high places of the Church it was as yet scarcely possible to
judge. The tone of the English episcopate had certainly
undergone a marked change for the better during the last
six years of Stephen’s reign. Theobald’s hopes must, however,
have been chiefly in the rising generation. Of the
existing bishops there was only one really capable of either
helping or hindering the work which the primate had at
heart; for Henry of Winchester, although his royal blood,
his stately personality and his long and memorable career
necessarily made him to his life’s end an important figure in
both Church and state, had ceased to take an active part in
the affairs of either, and for several years lived altogether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_492">492</a></span>
away from England, in his boyhood’s home at Cluny.<a id="Anchor_1611" href="#Footnote_1611" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1611.">[1611]</a> A
far more weighty element in the calculations of the reforming
party was the character and policy of the bishop of
Hereford, Gilbert Foliot. From the circumstances in which
we find Gilbert’s relatives in England,<a id="Anchor_1612" href="#Footnote_1612" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1612.">[1612]</a> it seems probable
that he belonged to one of the poorer Norman families of
knightly rank who came over either in the train of the great
nobles of the conquest or in the more peaceful immigration
under Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> His youth is lost in obscurity; of his
education we know nothing, save by its fruits. Highly
gifted as he unquestionably was by nature, even his inborn
genius could hardly have enabled him to acquire his refined
and varied scholarship, his unrivalled mastery of legal, political
and ecclesiastical lore, his profound and extensive
knowledge of men and things, anywhere but in some one
or other of the universities of the day. It is curious that
although Gilbert’s extant correspondence is one of the most
voluminous of the time—extending over nearly half a century,
and addressed to persons of the most diverse ranks,
parties, professions and nationalities—it contains not one
allusion to the studies or the companions of his youth,
not one of those half playful, half tender reminiscences of
student-triumphs, student-troubles and student-friendships,
which were so fresh in the hearts and in the letters of many
distinguished contemporaries. Only from an appeal made
to him, when bishop of London, in behalf of his old benefactor’s
orphan and penniless children, do we learn that he
had once been the favourite pupil, the ward, almost the
adoptive son, of a certain Master Adam.<a id="Anchor_1613" href="#Footnote_1613" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1613.">[1613]</a> It is tempting,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_493">493</a></span>
but perhaps hardly safe, to conjecture that this Master
Adam was the learned Englishman of that name who in like
manner befriended another young fellow-countryman, John
of Salisbury, when he too was studying in Paris.<a id="Anchor_1614" href="#Footnote_1614" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1614.">[1614]</a> This,
however, was not till Gilbert Foliot’s student-days had long
been past. Wherever his youth may have been spent,
wherever his reputation may have been acquired, the one was
quite over and the other was fully established before 1139,
when he had been already for some years a monk of Cluny,
had attained the rank of prior in the mother-house, and had
thence been promoted to become the head of the dependent
priory of Abbeville.<a id="Anchor_1615" href="#Footnote_1615" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1615.">[1615]</a></p>

<p>In 1139 the abbot of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Peter’s at Gloucester died;
Miles the constable, the lord of Gloucester castle and sheriff
of the county, and the greatest man of the district after Earl
Robert himself, secured the vacant office for Gilbert Foliot,<a id="Anchor_1616" href="#Footnote_1616" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1616.">[1616]</a>
who was a family connexion of his own.<a id="Anchor_1617" href="#Footnote_1617" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1617.">[1617]</a> The abbey of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Peter at Gloucester, founded as a nunnery in the seventh
century, changed into a college of secular priests after the
Danish wars, and finally settled as a house of Benedictine
monks in the reign of Cnut, had risen to wealth and fame
under its first Norman abbot, Serlo, some of whose work
still survives in the nave of his church, now serving as the
cathedral church of Gloucester. Gloucester itself, the capital
of Earl Robert’s territories, was still, like Hereford and
Shrewsbury, a border-city whose inhabitants had to be constantly
on their guard against the thievery and treachery of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_494">494</a></span>
the Welsh, who, though often highly useful to their English
earl as auxiliary forces in war, were anything but loyal
subjects or trustworthy neighbours. The position of abbot
of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Peter’s therefore was at all times one of some difficulty
and anxiety; and Gilbert entered upon it at a specially
difficult and anxious time. Stephen’s assent to his appointment
can hardly have been prompted by favour to Miles,
who had openly defied the king a year ago; he may have
been influenced by fear of giving fresh offence to such a
formidable deserter, or he may simply have been, as we are
told, moved by the report of Gilbert’s great merits.<a id="Anchor_1618" href="#Footnote_1618" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1618.">[1618]</a> The
new abbot proved quite worthy of his reputation. His
bitterest enemies always admitted that he was a pattern
of monastic discipline and personal asceticism; and his
admirable judgement, moderation and prudence soon made
him a personage of very high authority in the counsels of the
English Church. Holding such an important office in the
city which was the head-quarters of the Empress’s party
throughout the greater part of the civil war, he of course
had his full share of the troubles of the anarchy, whereof
Welsh inroads counted among the least. There is no doubt
that in bringing him to England Miles had, whether intentionally
or not, brought over one who sympathized strongly
with the Angevin cause; but Gilbert’s sympathies led him
into no political partizanship. During his nine years’ residence
at Gloucester he consistently occupied the position
which seems to have been his ideal through life: that of a
churchman pure and simple, attached to no mere party in
either Church or state, but ready to work with each and all
for the broad aims of ecclesiastical order and national tranquillity.
That these aims came at last to be identified with
the success of the Angevin party was a result of circumstances
over which Gilbert had no control. He was
honoured, consulted and trusted by the most diverse
characters among the bishops. Mere abbot of a remote
monastery as he was, Nigel of Ely was glad to be recommended
by him to Pope Celestine, Jocelyn of Salisbury<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_495">495</a></span>
to Lucius, and Alexander of Lincoln to Eugene <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr><a id="Anchor_1619" href="#Footnote_1619" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1619.">[1619]</a> He
was treated almost as an equal not only by his own diocesan
Bishop Simon of Worcester, by his neighbour Robert of
Hereford, and by Jocelyn of Salisbury, but even by the
archbishop of Canterbury and the legate Henry of Winchester;
and he writes in the tone of a patron and adviser
to Bishop Uhtred of Landaff and to the heads of the religious
houses on the Welsh border.<a id="Anchor_1620" href="#Footnote_1620" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1620.">[1620]</a> He seems indeed to have
been the usual medium of communication between the
Church in the western shires and its primate at far-off
Canterbury, who evidently found him a trustworthy and
useful agent in managing the very troublesome Church
affairs of the Welsh marches during the civil war.</p>

<p>When at last the storm subsided and a turn of the tide
came with the spring of 1148, Theobald openly shewed his
confidence in the abbot of Gloucester by commanding his
attendance on that journey to Reims which the king had
forbidden, and which was therefore looked upon as the grand
proclamation of ecclesiastical independence, as well as of
devotion to the house of Anjou. Gilbert, with characteristic
caution, excused himself on the plea that the troubles of his
house urgently required his presence at home;<a id="Anchor_1621" href="#Footnote_1621" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1621.">[1621]</a> but he ended
by going nevertheless,<a id="Anchor_1622" href="#Footnote_1622" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1622.">[1622]</a> and when his friend Bishop Robert of
Hereford—one of the three prelates whom Stephen had permitted
to attend the council of Reims—died during its
session, the Pope and the primate rewarded Gilbert with the
succession to the vacant see.<a id="Anchor_1623" href="#Footnote_1623" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1623.">[1623]</a> For his perjury in doing
homage to Stephen for its temporalities after swearing to
hold them only of Henry Fitz-Empress he may be supposed
to have quieted his conscience with the plea that there was
no other means of securing them for Henry’s benefit;—a
plea which Henry, after some delay,<a id="Anchor_1624" href="#Footnote_1624" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1624.">[1624]</a> found it wise to accept.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_496">496</a></span>
The heads of the Angevin party knew indeed that Gilbert
regarded all homage to Stephen as simply null and void; he
had just written it plainly to Brian Fitz-Count, when criticizing
Brian’s apology for the Empress, in a letter<a id="Anchor_1625" href="#Footnote_1625" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1625.">[1625]</a> which, we
may be very sure, must have been handed about and studied
among her friends as a much more valuable document than
the pamphlet which had called it forth.</p>

<p>The career of the new bishop of Hereford was but the
natural continuation of that of the abbot of Gloucester. His
more exalted office enabled him to be more than ever Theobald’s
right hand in the direction of the western dioceses.
In their secular policy he and Theobald were wholly at one;
whether they really were equally so in their ideas of Church
reform is a question which was never put to the test; but the
tone of Gilbert’s mind, so far as it can be made out from his
letters and from his course in after-years, does not seem to
have altogether harmonized with that which prevailed in the
primate’s household; and the one member of that household
with whom Gilbert was on really intimate terms was precisely
the one who, as afterwards appeared, had imbibed least of its
spirit—Roger of Pont-l’Evêque. Gilbert’s character is not
an easy one to read. Its inner depths are scarcely reflected
in his letters, which are almost all occupied with mere
business or formal religious exhortation; we never get from
him such a pleasant little stream of unpremeditated, discursive
talk as John of Salisbury or Peter of Blois delighted to
pour out of the abundance of their hearts into the ears of
some old comrade, or such a flood of uncontrolled passion as
revealed the whole soul of Thomas Becket. Gilbert’s letters
are carefully-balanced, highly-finished compositions; almost
every one of them reads as if it had received as much polishing,
in proportion to its length and importance, as the review
of Earl Brian’s book, which, the abbot owns, occupied what
should have been his hours of prayer during two days.<a id="Anchor_1626" href="#Footnote_1626" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1626.">[1626]</a> A
strong vein of sarcasm, very clever as well as very severe, is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_497">497</a></span>
the only token of personal feeling which at times forces its
way strangely, almost startlingly, through the veil of extreme
self-depreciation with which Gilbert strove to cover it. The
self-depreciation is even more disagreeable than the sarcasm;
yet it seems hardly fair to accuse Gilbert of conscious
hypocrisy. There was a bitter, sneering disposition ingrained
in his innermost being, and he knew it. His elaborate
expressions of more than monastic humility and meekness
may have been the outcome of a struggle to smother what
he probably regarded as his besetting sin; and if he not
only failed to smother it, but drifted into a much more
subtle and dangerous temptation, still it is possible that he
himself never perceived the fact, and was less a deceiver than
a victim of self-deception. During his episcopate at Hereford,
at any rate, no shadow of suspicion fell upon him from
any quarter; primate and Pope esteemed, trusted and consulted
him as one of the wisest as well as most zealous
doctors of the English Church; and when the young king
came to his throne he did not fail to shew a duly respectful
appreciation of Gilbert’s character and services.</p>

<p>The king’s own attitude towards the religious revival
was as yet not very clearly defined. Henry was not without
religious impulse; but it had taken a special direction
which indeed might naturally be expected in a grandson of
Fulk of Jerusalem<span class="nobreak">:—</span>a restless desire to go upon crusade.
He had no sooner mounted his throne than he began to
urge upon the English Pope, newly crowned like himself,
the importance of giving special attention to the necessities
of the Holy Land.<a id="Anchor_1627" href="#Footnote_1627" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1627.">[1627]</a> Four years later he proposed to join
Louis of France in a crusade against the Moors in Spain.
Louis wrote to the Pope announcing this project and begging
for his advice and support; Adrian in reply assured
the two kings of his sympathy and goodwill, but though
praising their zeal he expressed some doubt of its discretion,
advised them to ascertain whether the Spaniards desired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_498">498</a></span>
their help before thrusting it upon them unasked, and reminded
Louis in plain terms of the disastrous issue of his
former rash crusade.<a id="Anchor_1628" href="#Footnote_1628" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1628.">[1628]</a> The warning was needless, for it was

<p>His death was a heavy blow to the Church of his native
land; and it was followed by a schism which threatened
disastrous consequences to all western Christendom. Two
Popes were elected—Roland of Siena, cardinal of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Mark
and treasurer of the Holy See, and Octavian, cardinal of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr>
Cecilia, a Roman of noble birth. This latter, who assumed
the name of Victor <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr>, was favoured by the Emperor,
Frederic Barbarossa. After a violent struggle he was expelled
from Rome and fled to the protection of his imperial
patron, who thereupon summoned a general council to meet
at Pavia early in the next year and decide between the
rival pontiffs.<a id="Anchor_1630" href="#Footnote_1630" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1630.">[1630]</a> Only the bishops of Frederic’s own dominions
obeyed the summons, and only one of the claimants;
for Alexander <abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> (as Roland was called by his adherents)
disdained to submit to a trial whose issue he believed to
have been predetermined against him. He was accordingly
condemned as a rebel and schismatic, and Victor was
acknowledged as the lawful successor of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Peter.<a id="Anchor_1631" href="#Footnote_1631" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1631.">[1631]</a> This
decision, however, bound only the bishops of the Imperial
dominions; and its general acceptance throughout the rest
of Christendom, doubtful from the first, became impossible
when Alexander and his partizans published their account
of the mode by which it had been arrived at. Victor—so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_499">499</a></span>
their story went—had actually placed his pontifical ring in
the Emperor’s hands and received it back from him as the
symbol of investiture.<a id="Anchor_1632" href="#Footnote_1632" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1632.">[1632]</a> The Church at large could have no
hesitation in deciding that a man who thus climbed into the
sheepfold by surrendering, voluntarily and deliberately, the
whole principle of spiritual independence whose triumph
Gregory and Anselm had devoted their lives to secure, was
no true shepherd but a thief and robber. Frederic however
lost no time in endeavouring to obtain for him the adhesion
of France and England; and in the last-named quarter he
had great hopes of success. Henry had for several years
past shewn a disposition to knit up again the old political
ties which connected England with Germany; friendly embassies
had been exchanged between the two countries;<a id="Anchor_1633" href="#Footnote_1633" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1633.">[1633]</a>
now that he had begun to quarrel with France, too, he was
likely to be more inclined towards an imperial alliance.
Moreover it might naturally be expected that Frederic’s
bold and apparently successful attempt to revive the claims
of his predecessor Henry <abbr title="the Fourth">IV.</abbr> on the subject of ecclesiastical
investitures would meet with sympathy from the grandson
and representative of Henry <abbr title="the First">I.</abbr> Indeed, the official report
of the council of Pavia declares that Henry had actually, by
letters and envoys, given his assent to its proceedings.<a id="Anchor_1634" href="#Footnote_1634" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1634.">[1634]</a> But
nothing of the kind was known in Henry’s own dominions;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_500">500</a></span><a id="Anchor_1635" href="#Footnote_1635" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1635.">[1635]</a>

Another embassy from Henry
reached Frederic in Lombardy, in the winter of 1158–1159, immediately after one
from Louis. The object of each king was to secure Frederic’s alliance against the
other, in prospect of the coming war of Toulouse;

But the bishop of
Bamberg, also an eye-witness, says: “<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nuntius regis Francorum promisit pro eo

<p>Arnulf of Lisieux came of a family which had for more
than half a century been constantly mixed up in the diplomatic
concerns of Normandy and Anjou. Arnulf himself had
begun his career about 1130 by writing a treatise in defence
of an orthodox Pope against an usurper;<a id="Anchor_1636" href="#Footnote_1636" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1636.">[1636]</a> he had been
chosen to succeed his uncle Bishop John of Lisieux<a id="Anchor_1637" href="#Footnote_1637" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1637.">[1637]</a> shortly
before Geoffrey Plantagenet’s final conquest of Normandy,
and had bought at a heavy price his peace with the new
ruler;<a id="Anchor_1638" href="#Footnote_1638" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1638.">[1638]</a> and for the next forty years there was hardly a
diplomatic transaction of any kind, ecclesiastical or secular,
in England or in Gaul, in which he was not at some
moment and in some way or other concerned. He had
little official influence; he had indeed a certain amount of
territorial importance in Normandy, for Lisieux was the
capital of a little county of which the temporal as well as
the spiritual government was vested in the bishop; but a
Norman bishop, merely as such, had none of the political
weight of an English prelate; and Arnulf never held any
secular office. He was not exactly a busybody; he was a
consummate diplomatist, of wide experience and far-reaching
intelligence, with whose services no party could afford
to dispense; and his extraordinary caution and sagacity
enabled him to act as counsellor and guide of all parties at
once without sacrificing his own reputation as a sound
Churchman and a loyal subject. In his youth he had come
in contact with most of the rising scholars and statesmen of
the day in the schools of Paris; and as he was an indefatigable
and accomplished letter-writer, he kept up through life
a busy correspondence with men of all ranks and all schools
of thought on both sides of the sea.<a id="Anchor_1639" href="#Footnote_1639" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1639.">[1639]</a> During the quarrel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_501">501</a></span>
between Louis <abbr title="7">VII.</abbr> and Geoffrey Plantagenet concerning
the affair of Montreuil-Bellay, Arnulf was intrusted by
Suger with a chief part in the negotiations for the restoration
of peace;<a id="Anchor_1640" href="#Footnote_1640" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1640.">[1640]</a> the final settlement in 1151, whereby the
investiture of Normandy was secured to Henry, was chiefly
owing to his diplomacy;<a id="Anchor_1641" href="#Footnote_1641" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1641.">[1641]</a> he accompanied Henry to England
and was present at his crowning;<a id="Anchor_1642" href="#Footnote_1642" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1642.">[1642]</a> and on all questions
of continental policy he continued to be Henry’s chief
adviser till he was superseded by Thomas Becket.</p>

<p>To Arnulf there was nothing new or startling in a
schism at Rome; his experiences of thirty years before
enabled him to penetrate the present case at once, and as
then with his pen, so now with his tongue, he proved the
readiest and most powerful advocate of the orthodox pontiff.
Fortunately, Henry was in Normandy; before any one else
had time to gain his ear and bias his mind, before he himself
had time to think of forming an independent judgement on
the subject, Arnulf hurried to his side,<a id="Anchor_1643" href="#Footnote_1643" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1643.">[1643]</a> and set forth the
claims of Alexander with such convincing eloquence that the
king at once promised to acknowledge him as Pope. He
refrained however from issuing an immediate order for
Alexander’s acceptance throughout his dominions, partly in
deference to the Emperor,<a id="Anchor_1644" href="#Footnote_1644" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1644.">[1644]</a> and partly to make sure of the
intentions of the king of France. Louis, like Henry, had
sent a representative to the council of Pavia, but he had
taken care not to commit himself to any decision upon its
proceedings.<a id="Anchor_1645" href="#Footnote_1645" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1645.">[1645]</a> He was not naturally inclined to favour the
Emperor’s views. The question of the investitures had never
been as important in France as in Germany or in England,
and had been settled by a kind of tacit concordat which the
Most Christian King had no mind to forfeit his title by
disturbing; France was always the staunchest upholder of
the independence of the Apostolic see;<a id="Anchor_1646" href="#Footnote_1646" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1646.">[1646]</a> and neither king<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_502">502</a></span>
nor clergy desired to change their attitude. They met in
council at Beauvais some time in the summer of 1160; a
similar gathering of the Norman bishops, in Henry’s presence,
took place in July at Neufmarché; both assemblies
resulted in the acknowledgement of Alexander.<a id="Anchor_1647" href="#Footnote_1647" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1647.">[1647]</a> The formal
assent of the Churches of England and Aquitaine had still
to be obtained before either king would fully proclaim his
decision.<a id="Anchor_1648" href="#Footnote_1648" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1648.">[1648]</a> Archbishop Theobald’s anxious request for information
and instructions concerning the schism<a id="Anchor_1649" href="#Footnote_1649" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1649.">[1649]</a> was answered
by an exhaustive and eloquent statement of the case from
the pen of the indefatigable bishop of Lisieux;<a id="Anchor_1650" href="#Footnote_1650" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1650.">[1650]</a> and in
accordance with his directions the English bishops in council
assembled unanimously declared their acceptance of Alexander
<abbr title="the Third">III.</abbr> as the lawful successor of <abbr title="Saint">S.</abbr> Peter.<a id="Anchor_1651" href="#Footnote_1651" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1651.">[1651]</a></p>

<p>Alexander’s legates were already in Normandy;<a id="Anchor_1652" href="#Footnote_1652" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1652.">[1652]</a> unluckily,
however, the use which Henry made of their presence
led as we have seen to a fresh rupture between him and
Louis; and by this the Emperor and the anti-pope
immediately sought to profit. Tempting as their overtures
were to Henry, it does not appear that he ever seriously
entertained them; but the leaders of the English Church,
having now learned the circumstances of the case and grasped
the full importance of the triumph insured to the reforming
party by his acceptance of Alexander, were naturally alarmed
lest he should be induced to change his mind. Their
anxiety was increased by the enfeebled state of their own
ranks. The struggles of Bishop Richard of London to clear
off the debts incurred in raising a fine required by Stephen
at his election seemed to have only aggravated the confusion
of his affairs, which his friends the bishops of Hereford and
Lincoln were engaged in a desperate effort to disentangle,<a id="Anchor_1653" href="#Footnote_1653" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1653.">[1653]</a>

<p>The primate’s letters during the last few months of his
life shew him calmly awaiting his call to rest, yet anxiously
longing to be assured of the future of those whom he was
leaving behind, and to set in order a few things that were
wanting before he could depart altogether in peace. Very
touching are the expressions of his longing to “see the face
of the Lord’s anointed once again”—to welcome the king
back to his country and his home, safely removed from
political temptations to break away from the unity of the
Church.<a id="Anchor_1658" href="#Footnote_1658" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1658.">[1658]</a> And there was another for whose return Theobald
yearned more deeply still: his own long absent archdeacon—“the
first of my counsellors, nay, my only one,” as he
calls him, pleading earnestly with the king to let him come
home.<a id="Anchor_1659" href="#Footnote_1659" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1659.">[1659]</a> For a moment, indeed, Theobald was on the point
of being left almost alone. Some rather obscure mischief-making
in high places had caused John of Salisbury to be
visited with the king’s severe displeasure; treated as a suspected
criminal in England, forbidden to go and clear
himself in Normandy, John found his position so unbearable
that he contemplated taking refuge in France under the
protection of his old friend Abbot Peter of Celle.<a id="Anchor_1660" href="#Footnote_1660" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1660.">[1660]</a> He seems,
however, to have ended by remaining in England under<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_504">504</a></span>
Theobald’s protection; before the winter of 1160, at any
rate, he was again at Canterbury, watching over and tending
the primate’s gradual decline;—almost overwhelmed with
“the care of all the churches,” which Theobald had transferred
to him;<a id="Anchor_1661" href="#Footnote_1661" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1661.">[1661]</a>—characteristically finding relief from his
anxieties in correspondence with old friends, and in the
composition of another little philosophical treatise, called
<i>Metalogicus</i>, whose chief interest lies in the sketch which it
contains of its author’s early life.<a id="Anchor_1662" href="#Footnote_1662" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1662.">[1662]</a> John’s disinterested
affection and devoted services were fully appreciated by
Theobald;<a id="Anchor_1663" href="#Footnote_1663" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1663.">[1663]</a> but they could not make up for the absence of
Thomas. Not only did the old man long to see his early
favourite once more; not only were there grave matters of
diocesan administration dependent on the archdeacon’s office
and urgently requiring his personal co-operation:<a id="Anchor_1664" href="#Footnote_1664" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1664.">[1664]</a>—it was on
far weightier things than these that the archbishop desired
to hold counsel with Thomas. In the hands of Thomas, as
chief adviser and minister of the king, rested in no small
degree the future of the English Church; Theobald’s darling
wish was that it should rest in his hands as primate of all
England.<a id="Anchor_1665" href="#Footnote_1665" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1665.">[1665]</a></p>

<p>Later writers dilate upon the startling contrast between
Becket’s character and policy as chancellor and as archbishop.
That contrast vanishes when we look at the chancellor
through the eyes of the two men who knew him best; and
we find that the real contrast lies between their view of him
and that of the outside world which only saw the surface of
his life and could not fathom its inner depths. Those who
beheld him foremost in every military exercise and every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_505">505</a></span>
courtly pastime, far outdoing the king himself in lavish
splendour and fastidious refinement, devoting every faculty
of mind and body to the service and the pleasure of his
royal friend<span class="nobreak">:—</span>those who saw all this, and could only judge
by what they saw, might well have thought that for such a
man to become the champion of the Church was a dream to
be realized only by miracle or by imposture. But Archbishop
Theobald and John of Salisbury had known his inmost soul,
better perhaps than he knew it himself, before ever he went
to court; and they knew that however startling his conduct
there might look, he was merely fulfilling in his own way
the mission on which he had been sent thither<span class="nobreak">:—</span>making
himself all things to all men, if thereby he might by any
means influence the court and the king for good.<a id="Anchor_1666" href="#Footnote_1666" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1666.">[1666]</a> Even his
suggestion of the scutage for the war of Toulouse did not
seriously shake their faith in him; they blamed him, but
they believed that he had erred in weakness, not in wilfulness.<a id="Anchor_1667" href="#Footnote_1667" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1667.">[1667]</a>
In the middle of the war John dedicated the
<i>Polycraticus</i> to him as the one man about the court to whom
its follies and its faults could be criticized without fear,
because he had no part in them.<a id="Anchor_1668" href="#Footnote_1668" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1668.">[1668]</a> Thomas himself does not
seem to have contemplated the possibility of removal from
his present sphere. It was not in his nature at any time to
look far ahead; and Henry seemed to find his attendance
more indispensable than ever, declaring in answer to
Theobald’s intreaties and remonstrances that he could not
possibly spare him till peace was thoroughly restored.<a id="Anchor_1669" href="#Footnote_1669" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1669.">[1669]</a></p>

<p>Thomas was in a strait. His first duty was to his
dying spiritual father; but he could not go against the
king’s will without running such a risk as Theobald would
have been the first to disapprove. Thomas himself therefore
at last suggested that the archbishop should try to move the
king by summoning his truant archdeacon to return home
at once on pain of deprivation.<a id="Anchor_1670" href="#Footnote_1670" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1670.">[1670]</a> Theobald, unable to
reconcile the contradictory letters of king and chancellor<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_506">506</a></span>
with the general reports of their wonderful unanimity, steered
a middle course between severity and gentleness, from fear
of bringing down the royal displeasure upon his favourite,
whom he yet half suspected of being in collusion with the
king. His secretary, John, had no such doubts; but he too
was urgent that by some means or other Thomas should
come over before the primate’s death.<a id="Anchor_1671" href="#Footnote_1671" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1671.">[1671]</a> If he did go, it can
only have been for a flying visit; and there is no sign that
he went at all. One thing he did obtain for Theobald’s
satisfaction: the appointment of Bartholomew archdeacon
of Exeter to the bishopric of that diocese.<a id="Anchor_1672" href="#Footnote_1672" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1672.">[1672]</a> In April
Richard Peche, on whom the see of Chester had been
conferred, was consecrated at Canterbury by Walter of
Rochester, the archbishop being carried into the chapel to
sanction by his presence the rite in which he was too feeble
to assist.<a id="Anchor_1673" href="#Footnote_1673" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1673.">[1673]</a> By the hand of the faithful secretary John he
transmitted to King Henry his last solemn benediction and
farewell, and commended to the royal care the future of his
church and the choice of his successor.<a id="Anchor_1674" href="#Footnote_1674" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1674.">[1674]</a> A few days later,
on April 18, 1161, the good primate passed away.<a id="Anchor_1675" href="#Footnote_1675" class="fnanchor" title="Go to footnote 1675.">[1675]</a></p>

<div class="transnote">

<h3 class="nopagebreak" title="" id="endtn">Transcriber’s Note</h3>

<p>The Errata have been moved to the end of the book, the corrections
listed in them have been applied to this transcription.</p>

<p>Footnotes have been renumbered and moved to the end of paragraphs.</p>

<p>All references to footnote numbers (i.e. page and note number) are
followed by the footnote number used here in braces e.g. {386}.</p>

<p>Some formatting and punctuation in citations and the index
have been standardized.</p>

<p>Variant spelling, inconsistent hyphenation and inconsistent spelling
of people’s names are retained, as are inconsistent punctuation after
roman numerals (e.g. “i.” and “i” both occur) and inconsistent use of italics, however a few palpable printing errors
have been corrected.</p>

<p>“Guib. Noviog. Opp. Opp.” has been changed to “Guib. Noviog. Opp.” in all the footnotes it occurs.</p>

<p>In footnote <a href="#Footnote_727" title="Go to footnote 727.">727</a> (originally Page 289 Footnote 5) “The the king” is quoted correctly.</p>

<p>In footnote <a href="#Footnote_1040" title="Go to footnote 1040.">1040</a> (originally Page 360 Footnote 1) “xcix*” has been changed to “lix*” in “see
    <cite>Dugdale, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la"><abbr title="Monasticon Anglicanum">Monast. Angl.</abbr></i>, <abbr title="volume 6">vol. vi.</abbr>
<abbr title="part">pt.</abbr> 2, <abbr title="pages">pp.</abbr> <abbr title="3*–59*">iii*–lix*</abbr></cite>”.</p>

<p>In footnote <a href="#Footnote_1229" title="Go to footnote 1229.">1229</a> “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">De Nugis Curialibus</i>” has been changed to “<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">De Nugis Curialium</i>” </p>

<p>In footnote <a href="#Footnote_1291" title="Go to footnote 1291.">1291</a> The closing bracket has been moved:<br />
“<abbr title="John of Salisbury">Joh. Salisb.</abbr>, <abbr title="Epistle 78">Ep. lxxviii.</abbr> (Giles, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 109;
    Robertson, <i>Becket</i>, <abbr title="volume 5">vol. v.</abbr> Ep. ix. <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 13).”<br />
has been changed to<br />
“<cite><abbr title="John of Salisbury">Joh. Salisb.</abbr>, <abbr title="Epistle 78">Ep. lxxviii.</abbr> (Giles, <abbr title="volume 1">vol. i.</abbr> <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 109)</cite>;
    <cite>Robertson, <i>Becket</i>, <abbr title="volume 5">vol. v.</abbr> Ep. ix. <abbr title="page">p.</abbr> 13</cite>.”</p>

<p>Now the abbreviations “ib.” and “ibid.” are used to refer to the same work as a previous reference on the same page,
as is “as above”.
Moving footnotes to the end of paragraphs, has meant that occasionally these abbreviations refer to citations in a previous paragraph’s footnotes,
so the transcriber has replaced these with the citation to which they refer,
the replaced text is shown <span class="ibs">·/·</span><span class="ibc">thus</span>.</p>
